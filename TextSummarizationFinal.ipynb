            "Collision avoidance on air traffic becomes very important to be investigated as the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system aims to increase the safety of the airplane passengers. The Collision Avoidance (CA) has been studied in many researches on Detection and Resolution (CDR). The general solution for CA uses three types of manoeuvres on an airplane, namely speed, altitude and angle of direction of flight. The aim of the CDR is to create a standard procedure to help the airplane controller and pilot when action to prevent conflicts is not successful. For example, when two or more airplanes violate the specified safety criteria to maintain the minimum horizontal distance between airplanes by 5 Nm or the minimum vertical distance by 1,000 ft. This criterion is referred to as the Protected Zone (PZ). The proposed solution must be able to maintain a predetermined flight schedule.  One solution to this problem is to consider speed and altitude manoeuvres. The model that uses this solution is called the Velocity and Altitude Change (VAC) model proposed by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2011). The proposed method uses the geometry construction and the Velocity Change (VC) model introduced by (Pallottino et al., 2002). The proposed VAC model uses a Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization (MILO) approach VAC aims to find the optimal speed and altitude so that an airplane avoids pre-defined conflict criteria as well as to minimize the change of flight schedules. Pallottino et al. (2002)  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  34 proposed a VC model using the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method. Alonso-Ayuso et al. (2011) then enhanced this model by adding anomaly cases and false conflicts. The anomaly cases are used to detect the zero-divisors in the geometry construction while the false conflict aims to identify if two airplanes move to opposite directions. An alternative solution is also produced using the height manoeuvre variable. Alonso-Ayuso et al. (2011) created groups of airplanes based on altitude levels with 1,000 ft distance between the groups. The Altitude Change (AC) proposed by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2011) considers the detection of a pair of airplanes towards each other, a head to head situation. Alonso-Ayuso et al. (2012) proposed a MILO model that not only considers VC but also takes into account the acceleration factor to avoid instantaneous changes. The research modified the native VAC by considering Coordinated Velocity and Altitude Changes (CVAC) based on MILO models. This model did not include CDR problems. A Mixed-Integer Non-linear Optimization (MINO) model for handling the CDR problems (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) is proposed. The proposed MINO model produces high accuracy but requires a high computational cost. Another scheme enhanced the MINO model with an additional three airplane manoeuvres variables, i.e., Velocity, angle Turn and Altitude level Change (VTAC). The enhanced model requires less computational cost, called the Sequential Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization (SMILO), in a trade-off of a slightly lower accuracy (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a). The optimization models in the previous studies did not involve the presence of cumulonimbus clouds. In fact, many cumulonimbi can be found in tropical countries, e.g., Indonesia. Cumulonimbus clouds are a tall, dense cloud type that tends to grow vertically rather than horizontally. This cloud is formed due to water vapour carried by very strong upward air currents. The cumulonimbus clouds are very dangerous since they can cause an airplane to experience turbulence and even can cause the engine to fail. An optimization model that involves the cumulonimbus cloud is important to avoid collisions with such clouds. Research in (Purwananto et al., 2019) presents a heuristic approach using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to avoid conflicts between the planes and simulate the cumulonimbus cloud to be avoided by a plane. However, the experimental results are not shown in detail. In this study, we develop an optimization model to enhance the proposed optimization model by   (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) to solve CA problems and VTAC airplane manoeuvres by considering the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds. We use the SCIP Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solver (Gleixner et al., 2017) due to its computational efficiency.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The review of research is presented in section 2, the methodology of our research is presented in section 3, experimental results are presented in section 4 and finally, the conclusion is presented in section 5. Related Work Collision-Conflict Avoidance is divided into two categories, namely Conflict-collision Detection (CD) and Collision Resolution (CR). CD is the process of detecting conflicts between two or more airplanes or between an airplane and some obstacles in the airspace, while CR is a decision or solution for the completion of the CD solution. As an illustration, suppose there are two airplanes in the same horizontal plane. Each airplane has a flight plan consisting of a sequence of points for each time t at speed v. An airplane can detect a potential conflict to the other airplane by using TRACON (a radar approach control terminal). If the airplane detects the presence of the other airplane within 5 nm outside of TRACON and 3 nm inside TRACON, then the situation is classified as unsafe. Another criterion of flight safety is the vertical distance of airplanes should be at least 5 nm or 1,000 ft. The research in (Kuchar and Yang, 2000) was known as the first study on Conflict Detection and Resolution (CDR) problem. The research used a mathematical optimization approach to solve the problem. Then, (Martín Campo, 2010) used a similar approach and offered various methods and algorithms to solve the collision avoidance problem. A survey of intelligent transportation systems in (Zhang et al., 2011) presented models used to solve airline conflict problems. Then, efforts are conducted to improve the models by using optimization algorithms for conflict avoidance by involving variations in speed, direction, altitude and the possibility of returning to the starting point of flight. Research in (Shi et al., 2012) was enhanced by adding a predictor of air traffic density and its implementation in airplane lane planning. The research was developed based on a simplified stochastic differential equation model of airplane dynamics, as demonstrated in (Albasman and Hu, 2012). Metaheuristic algorithms are also used for CDR problems. For example, the Ant Colony algorithm (Durand and Alliot, 2009; Meng and Qi, 2012; Gao et al., 2012) were used for decision-making angle Turn (TC) manoeuvres. The Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2015) that considers possible influential factors to the TC problem was developed in (Omer and Farges, 2013) that used a combination or hybrid method to solve the same problem. The use of linear approach also produced satisfactory results, such as the Neural Network approach for the Velocity Change (VC) manoeuvres problem (Cetek, 2009; Christodoulou and Kodaxakis, 2006; Durand et al., 2000). A linear approach based on Taylor iterative  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  35 polynomials was proposed by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2012), which then resumed in (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) by using the Sequential Integer Linear Optimization (SILO) method. Linear and metaheuristic approaches are well known due to their computational efficiency. The trade-off of the approaches is that there is no guarantee a global-optima solution and sometimes even a feasible solution, is found. A non-linear approach is used to build a mixed 0-1 non-linear model to solve the collision avoidance problem (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2010; 2012). The non-linear approach is applied for optimization algorithms with mixed-integer that involved trigonometry and non-convex equations (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016). The approach offered horizontal and vertical manoeuvres. A two-stage approach, namely angular deviation and mixed 0-1 non-linear model calculations, was used in (Cafieri and Omheni, 2017) to avoiding air traffic conflicts. The approach implemented gradual changes in heading angles and heights. Research in an unmanned airplane was initiated in (Smith et al., 2013) that proposed an optimization on airborne collision avoidance. Further research in this field (Foina et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017) developed a geometric conflict resolution method for distributed cooperative drones. The study focused on calculating the safe separation boundary from a pairwise drone. The non-linear tangent function to safely separate the drones is transformed into a linear boundary by mapping the relation into the sin value space. Search And Rescue (SAR) airplanes pose a unique challenge as they often perform their operations in low-altitude. This condition requires different modelling, given that flying in low-altitude is very prone to collisions. Research in (Zhang et al., 2017) proposed solutions to this problem using a standard aviation visual separation model. The study was divided into two sub problems: A pairwise and many planes. Conflict scenarios are divided based on the path of the airplane and the mission carried. The outcomes of the solutions are decisions to fly higher, to change lanes and or to change speed. In general, there are three classifications of periods for providing solutions to the CDR problem: Long, medium and short terms. The division is based on the time period of when a solution to a problem is issued, for example, 20 to 60 min for the long term, 5 to 20 min for the medium term and 2 to 5 min for the short term, respectively. The short term solutions were initially researched in (Shakarian and Haraldsdottir, 2001) and then further enhanced by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a). The study in (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) was developed using multi-objective optimization-based techniques, which demonstrated that the metaheuristic approach is efficient. The state-of-the-art to solve the CDR problem with the use of a non-linear optimization algorithm is the MINO model (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) using the Minotaur solver (Mahajan et al., 2020), while the use of sequential mixed integer optimization SMILO model (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) using the CPLEX solver (IBM, 2015). CPLEX is also a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solver. Both algorithms are well known due to their good performance in solving the CDR problem. The SMILO model requires less computational cost, in a trade-off of a slightly lower accuracy than MINO model. However, they do not cover the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds in their modelling. Many of cumulonimbus clouds can be found in tropical countries, where this dense cloud type tends to grow vertically rather than horizontally. The CB clouds are very dangerous as they can cause an airplane to experience turbulence and even can cause the engine to fail. An optimization model that involves the CB cloud is important to avoid collisions with such clouds. Research in (Purwananto et al., 2019) presents a heuristic approach using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to avoid conflicts between the plane using SMILO model and simulate the cumulonimbus cloud to be avoided by a plane. However, the experimental results are not shown in detail. In this study, an enhancement of the MINO optimization model is proposed to solve CA problems and VTAC airplane manoeuvres by considering the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds. We use the Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solver SCIP (Gleixner et al., 2017) due to the computational issue of MINO. Methodology Our air traffic model is the extended version of VTAC model (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) to solve CA problem by considering the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds. The aircraft can perform three types of maneuvers to avoid conflict situations: Changes in velocity and angle turn (horizontal maneuvers) and changes in altitude levels (vertical maneuvers). The Velocity Change (VC) allow Airplane to Change the velocity for avoiding the collision. The altitude change (AC) considers the detection of a pair of airplanes towards each other, a head to head situation. The two types of inputs are needed such as the pre-processing parameters (meters) and Cumulonimbus (CB) cloud parameters. The outputs are the optimal velocity, angle turn and altitude level that meet the requirements for avoiding collisions.

This variable can be divided into 2 nonnegative variables  and  f Variation of angle to avoid conflict situations. This variable can be divided into 2 non-negative variables  and   A non-negative integer variable which is the value of altitude level that is allowable for a plane to climb  Non-negative integer variable which is the value of altitude level that is allowable for the plane to descend Output Parameters For every plane and CB cloud fF, the output result is in the following:   Optimal velocity,    Optimal angle turn,   Optimal altitude level, z:fz = 1  Constraints The CDR constraints are as follows: For every plane and CB cloud fF:   (1)  For every pair of planes {i, j}P and zZ:   (2a)   (2b)   (2c)   (2d)   (2e)  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  37  (2f)   (2g)   (2h)  In order to detect and solve the conflict situation, the set of constraints Equation (2) are used. The pathological situations are avoided in the model since each constraint is controlled by parameter pcij. The pcij is set to 1 in the pre-processing phase if there exists a pathological situation between plane i and j. For every pair of plane and CB cloud {i, j}P and zZ:   (3)  Constraint Equation (3) forces the following situations: (a) only one of the four possible cases in the geometric construction for the horizontal maneuvers (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) in the pair of plane and CB cloud, (b)  which forces the case in which two planes or CB cloud fly at different altitude levels, so there is no longer potential conflict situation between them. For each plane and CB cloud fF:   (4)  The constraint Equation (4) imposes that each plane and CB cloud must fly at only one altitude level. For every pair of plane and CB cloud {i, j}P and zZ:  (5)  The constraint Equation (5) splits the two values for -variables. For , it forces a situation in which only one aircraft or CB cloud (i or j) can fly at altitude level z at most. For , the constraint is inactive, which means that the constraint Equation (2)-(4) determine the altitude level at which the separation maneuver is made for both plane and CB cloud if any (either at the same altitude level or at different altitude levels). For each plane fF:   (6a)   (6b)  The zf is the initial configuration for plane f constrained by Equation 61-6b (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a). The variable, f, in the equations count the level's numbers by which plane f simultaneously update its altitude. The variables  and  are related with the initial altitude level of each aircraft. The Equation (6a) and (6b) counts the number of altitude levels between the new configuration and the initial one. If the plane has changed its initial altitude level then only one of the two constraints is greater than 0, thus satisfying the non-negativity requirement for variable . Observe then that the objective function Equation (10) (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) forces a weighted sum of variables . For each plane and CB cloud fF:   (7a)   (7b)   (7c)   (7d)  For each plane and CB cloud fF and zZ:   (7e)  For every pair of plane and CB cloud {i, j}P and zZ:   (7f)  For each plane and CB cloud fF:    (7g)  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  38 Finally, the constraint system Equation (7a)-(7g) defines the range value of the variables. The geometric construction might change some initial configurations of plane even if they are not involved in a conflict situation (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b). These cases are called false conflicts since two aircraft, i and j, are moving away from each other, the geometric construction forces them to perform unnecessary maneuvers to avoid conflict situation. It also needs to consider those cases in which two plane, i and j, are flying at different altitudes with a horizontal distance of less than the minimum required, usually 5 nm (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b). The parameter forces the two planes involved to fly at different altitudes since otherwise, they are in conflict.  In order to solve the conflict over possible collision between plane and plane, or plane and CB cloud, some maneuver such as horizontal maneuver (velocity and angle changes) and or vertical maneuver (altitude level changes) must satisfy the three objective functions as Equation (8) and (9):   (8)   (9)   (10)  Experimental Environment We conducted our experiment using the Software framework for Constraint Integer Programs (SCIP) optimization suite (Gleixner et al., 2017). SCIP is known due to its very efficient yet accurate in solving the VAC and the VTAC problems. SCIP uses a branch and bound approach complemented with the Linear Programming (LP) relaxations and cutting plane separators to solve Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) and Satisfiability (SAT) problems. A problem instance is continuously divided into two sub-problems until it is infeasible to do so. At this point, an optimal solution for the sub-problem can be identified. The LP relaxation of a sub-problem is obtained by dropping the integrality restrictions of the n be solved more efficiently and provides a dual bound on the objective value. The dual bound is then used for the bounding step in the initial branch-and-bound algorithm. Once the LP relaxation of a sub-problem is obtained, SCIP exploits the integrality restrictions to tighten the relaxation and thereby improve the bound obtained. The safe distance is measured in NM (Pallottino et al., 2002). We run our experiment in a considerably small area of 120×120 NM to mimic a very condense flight area where collisions occur. Experimental Scenario We used six airplanes flying on the same altitude with given X-Y coordinates and angles (see Table 1). We used a range of [3,5] speed where normally airplanes that fly on the same level are of the same type with a similar speed profile. We set the minimum safety distance between airplanes at 2.5; Nm considered as the safe distance (Pallottino et al., 2002). We run our experiment in a considerably small area of 120×120 NM to mimic a very condense flight area where collisions occur. In the first experiment, we optimized the route of every airplane by using VAC and VTAC algorithms. The algorithms provide recommendations to maintain or change the speed, angle and or altitude of every airplane when a potential collision is detected. In the second experiment, we included a dynamic cloud in collision avoidance modelling (Table 2). Although a cloud can be seen as a native aerial object (such as an airplane), however, the dynamic pose a different challenge to the modelling. The characteristic of a cloud that could lay on several altitude levels restricts any objects (such as airplanes) to go across the cloud. In addition, the diameter of a cloud is far wider than an airplane. Thus, the safety distance is defined as the flight safety radius + the radius of the cloud on every altitude level. Based on the speed, direction and altitude of the airplanes, we simulated the position of the airplanes in ten iterations. We record the airplane coordinates during the simulation that form airplane tracks. A unique character plot in a track indicates the current position of an airplane, while the line plot in a track indicates the airplane trails. At iteration number ten, a collision will occur between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 when their original routes are applied in Fig. 1a. The collision is indicated by the zero distance between them (Fig. 2a). VAC Modelling Solution We run the VAC algorithm at each iteration in our flight simulation. The collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 in the initial flight route simulation (Fig. 1a) is avoided. The avoided collision is indicated by the non-zero distance (> 5 NM) along the (Fig. 1b). The new routes are obtained by changing the speed and or altitude for every airplane to meet the safety distance constraint (). This result proves that the VAC algorithm is effective to prevent the collision between Airplane 2 and 3. We then included a dynamic cloud in our simulation and run the VAC algorithm in our collision avoidance modelling. Here, we model the dynamic cloud as an aerial object with a large radius (e.g., 7.5 Nm), low  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  39 velocity and occupies several altitude layers. Note that the safety radius is the addition of the cloud radius and the pane safety radius and therefore 7.5+2.5 Nm = 10 Nm (Table 2). We run our simulation using the same six flights (Table 1) with the addition of cumulonimbus clouds (Table 2). With the default scenario, this experiment results in the collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 and also between Airplane 4 and the cloud (Fig. 1c). Then, we run our collision avoidance modelling using the same scenario. The VAC modelling provides route changes (altitude or speed) for every airplane to avoid collision between airplanes and the cloud (Fig. 1d). The collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 are avoided as well as the collision between Airplane 4 and the cloud (the red circle). Our experiment result indicates that collisions between airplanes and the clouds are avoided indicated by non-zero distances of every airplane to any other objects in the simulation (Fig. 2b).

Then, we compare the solutions produced by the VTAC modelling against the VAC modelling. The collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 is avoided by >6 NM (Fig. 3a). The distance produced by the VTAC modelling is longer than the VAC modelling (>5 NM). The longer distance is due to the VTAC modelling not only for providing solutions to change speed and altitude, but also the angle of the planes. The change of angle is indicated by the route of Airplane 2 that moves away from Airplane 3 by moving towards positive direction of the Y axis (Fig. 3a). This result proves that the VTAC modelling produces a safer solution than that of the VAC modelling. In fact, not only the collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 is avoided, but also the distance between Airplane 1 and Airplane 4 is extended.

The routes of the other airplanes are not changed because the distances between them are sufficiently far (Fig. 4a).  A dynamic cloud and six airplanes are run in our simulation with the same type and details as in the VAC scenario (Table 1 and 2). Here, the collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 is avoided by >6 NM (Fig. 3b) by the change of speed (Airplane 3) and the change of angle (Airplane 2). Now, the presence of cloud that lies on altitude level 2, 3 and 4 is avoided by changing the angle of Airplane 4. The course of Airplane 4 is still in the safety zone despite the presence and the course of Airplane 1 (Fig. 4b). This solution is more practical compared to changing the altitude of Airplane 4 to level 1 as proposed by the VAC modelling (Fig. 1d). We extended our experiment by using 16 airplanes flying on altitude 1, 3 and 4. First, the simulation was run without the use of our VTAC algorithm resulting in minimum, maximum and average distances of 60, 1720.5 and 831.1 Nm respectively. There is no change of altitude levels among the airplanes. Then, we run the same simulation with the use of our VTAC algorithm. The experiment resulted in minimum, maximum and average distances of 141.4, 1720.5 and 830.4 Nm respectively. The minimum distances expanded as the results of the change of the altitude levels of some airplanes. This experiment strengthens our initial experimental result. Conclusion We developed an effective collision avoidance modelling that involves airplanes and a dynamic cloud that could be applicable in countries with cumulonimbus clouds, e.g., Indonesia. The VAC modelling was successfully experimented to avoid a collision by lowering the altitude and or change no cloud that lays on every altitude level. However, when such cloud exists, the technique might not work. This problem is solved in VTAC modelling that includes the change of flight angle. Thus, a collision with such cloud that lays on every altitude level can be avoided. The VTAC algorithm produced longer distance to avoid collision between airplanes by at least 1 Nautical Mile (NM) compared to the VAC algorithm. The addition of angle in the VTAC algorithm has improved the result significantly. Our collision avoidance method could be extended to multi clouds. We would like to use a real data from the Air Traffic Controller to examine the robustness of our method. The characteristics of large-scale real data with its various flight scenarios could possibly give a more deeper insight to the development of our method.

            " Lately, several papers regarding online Arabic recognition have been published. However, they do not properly handle all the features of Arabic Language. However, the diacritics of each word completely change the meaning of the word. However, no Arabic dataset contains information regarding these marks in the ground truth files. Lately, benchmark databases have appeared. However, the oldest and most widespread database is IFN\\ENIT, which includes texts written by 411 people with 26,459 words (Pechwitz et al., 2002; El Abed and Margner, 2007). Here, a platform was designed to collect handwritten information. Overall, 12000 samples with over 42000 characters and 23300 sub-words were included. However, no information regarding the time was considered. Hence, it is not particularly useful for writer identification. In many cases, Arabic words consist of more than one sub-words. For this reason, the last two options (Bar to Tah and Zah and complement to Kaf) have been included as shown in Fig. 2.

            " Software testing is an activity that plays an important role in the software development process (Bourque et al., 2014). Software testing can be automated or manual (Meszaros, 2007). Fig. Another important test smells are code duplication and slow test execution (Meszaros, 2007). 1 use this strategy, which produces code duplication smell (Meszaros, 2007). Another fixture setup strategy is implicit setup (Meszaros, 2007). However, both approaches break the independency principle. However, SolUnit does not aim to reduce test code duplication. In Fig. The test class presented in Fig. 4 depends on the test class presented in Fig. 2. We say that the test class of Fig. 4. 4. 2. 3 does not use the bs fixture, then the test class in Fig. Fig. 4: Test class to create a account    Fig. 4, 6 and 7.

After that, the header  recently added node Node(X). Like FP-tree, the Improved FP-tree construction algorithm also requires two database scans to construct the tree.

Theoretically, eight is the ideal entropy value for the grayscale image with size 256256 (Dawahdeh et al., 2018). The higher the PSNR value, the closer the cipher image to its plain image (Sethi and Vijay, 2013). For good image encryption technique, PSNR value should be the most minimum. The Eq. (11) is used to compute PSNR (Taneja et al., 2012). UACI reflects the difference of average intensity between cipher image and plain image (Taneja et al., 2012). Thus, a limit value (benchmark) to determine a good result must be set. Therefore, ECCHC technique is also unable to produce good result of UACI since 78% is lower than 100%. Therefore, ECCHC technique does not guarantee providing an image encryption with 100% work well on all grayscale and RGB images and does not guarantee that these encrypted images are 100% resist against entropy attack, differential attack (due to entropy and UACI value that is far away from their identical value) and the cipher image might reveal the secrecy of the plain image as well due to high value of PSNR. Fig. 4 and 5 for grayscale and RGB colour images, respectively. 4, 56% of the moderate encrypted grayscale images (23 images) promise the secrecy of the plain image.

            " Because of that, the systems they developed are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Machine learning part will undergo some training and which will then be used to scan the log for classifying where the log is being injected or not. Therefore, the attacker needs to send a payload to be able to reconstruct the database structure, observing the response from the web application to see the behaviour of the database server. Therefore, before the website is published, the function of error handling needs to be cleared and disabled (Chaturvedi et al., 2016). Machine learning is another method to use for detection. Therefore, multi-stage log analysis is set to use both log analysis pattern matching and machine learning.

            " In software engineering field, the software flaw prediction system is having more importance. Today, software development has become a highly competitive field. Also, these techniques have been used to plan production process improvements. Treatments using these principles are not included (Ghaffarinasab et al., 2020). Once software has indicated defects, it leads to incorrect performance. Software error monitoring is a fundamental method for error identification and bug detection. (Agarwal and Tomar, 2014; Trivedi and Pachori, 2010). Fig. The results indicate that the forecasts are usually well-motivated and that the classification was more 'confident' in their accurate predictions on average (Miholca et al., 2018). NASA Metrics Data Software (MDP) registry collected data. Artificial intelligence can dynamically use data mines to learn consistent software predictors. Approximately one-third of the overall software cost is due to software bugs (Wagner, 2006). Using data analysis tools, software bugs are classified. This paper has examined different forms of bug classification techniques. This paper finds a more practical approach (Clerc, 2007). Software errors or software defects are dangerous and costly (Faizan et al., 2012). For large-scale software systems, an accurate defect prediction model is required.

            " This is the case for APTs. Furthermore, the invader is quite persistent. The key words for APT are stealthy, targeted, adjustable and focused. To investigate the perpetrators behind criminal cases, the term investigation is commonly used. According to Levine (2013), APTs are successful because they are highly specialized and always untraceable. Having high rates of success. According to Moon et al. According to Lima (2015), the main difference between this threat and all others, old viruses are not a sophisticated problem and it' s easy to discover their signature and it' s possible to detect malware running on a system. Not in the case of APTs. According to Wendt et al. According to Adelaiye et al. According to the author, traditional computer security systems are ineffective against these types of threats. According to Alkan (2018), APT-type attacks are highly effective and cause enormous damages. According to Ghafir and Prenosil (2014), the use of zero-days technology creates an inability for conventional detection and security mechanisms to find evidence of these attacks. According to Wagner et al. (2017), APTs require a greater understanding and holistic approach, which means that traditional systems do not detect them, he states they are a very significant threat to current systems. According to Khan (2020), traditional security solutions are not applicable to APTs. According to Li et al. (2018), APTs are a new type of attacks characterized by difficulty in detection and with a serious problem in traditional Cyber Security defense processes. According to Stalling (2018), it states that APTs are all successful mainly due to the fact that they use \"zero-days exploits.\" According to Joloudari et al. (2020), traditional detection systems do not work with APTs. According to Mustafa (2013), the sophistication of these types of attacks is increasing and it is essential to study new ways to address the problem. According to Virvillis (2014), these types of attacks go completely unnoticed by traditional detection mechanisms. According to Mirza et al. (2014), he regards APTs as the most fearsome threats in technical terms. According to Wang et al. Thus undetectable by traditional technological processes. According to Quader (2021), these types of attacks are among the most dangerous. According to Ussath et al. (2016), traditional attack detection methods are not applicable to APTs. According to Chandra et al. (2016), APTs are undetectable by their own nature and nowadays they have increased their sophistication exponentially. According to Min et al. (2017), APTs are difficult to detect and cause huge losses of information, new techniques are required to address the problem. According to Zhang et al. (2017), APT attacks are different from traditional Cyber Security attacks and present enormous challenges. According to Yang et al. (2018b), APTs always manage to avoid traditional Cyber Security defenses. According to Khosravi-farmad et al. Other approaches are required. According to Yan et al. (2019), APTs are currently considered the most sophisticated cybercrime weapons that exist. According to Joloudari et al. According to Zou (2020), it' s extremely difficult to trace APTs with currently existing solutions. According to Tankard (2011), APTs are not detectable in their early stage, one of the solutions is to develop a solution consisting of several differentiated elements that added together can cover all the characteristics of APTs. According to Auty (2015), a change in mindset is needed to come up with a solution to APT-type attacks. According to Cheng et al. According to Cheng et al. (2020), even in IoT it is difficult to manage detecting APTs with conventional mechanisms. According to Chen et al. (2018), APTs cause too much damage before they can be detected, when they are detected. According to Lv et al. (2019), conventional Cyber Security defenses do not work with APTs. According to Friedberg et al. (2015), current Cyber Security attack protection mechanisms are insufficient for APT-type attacks. According to Berrada et al. (2020), traditional security systems do not solve the problem of APTs, they are among current undetectable systems. According to Ghafir et al. According to Prenosil (2014), APTs are an issue for current detection systems, it's not possible to come up with a solution that goes exclusively through technology, it has to be an integrated set of several solutions. According to one of the world's leading experts on Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), (Cole, 2012), an author recognized as such by the entire scientific community, APTs are a completely different issue from all others. Moreover, it' s quite persistent. According to the author we need a new way to approach the issue. The main problem, however, is that Microsoft was unable to detect the attack. According Rid and Buchanan (2015), the MICTIC model focuses exclusively on technical issues and should also focus on issues of a political nature and human actions. According Fraser et al. Obviously, many government agencies and companies will have action templates and even Frameworks, yet they don't publicize them or share them with the academic community. Recent studies agree that the approach must be different and broader (Virvillis, 2014). Jasek et al. Obviously, social engineering through its tools plays an important role here. exposed information (Rubio, 2020). This suite has five main tools.\n",

This DataSet contains about 24K different tables. There are two leaderboards for the WikiSQL challenge: Weakly supervised (without using logical form during training) and supervised (with logical form during training). There are also some works that do both at different layers (Hwang et al., 2019; He et al., 2019). However, it is found challenging in output syntax. It provides tree sets: Train, dev and test set. The WikiSQL dataset consists of 80,654 pairs of SQL questions and queries spread across 24,241 Wikipedia tables. Fig. 1: SQL clauses     Fig. 2: Example of WikiSQL DataSet.

            " Therefore, it is not surprising, if many tertiary institutions adopted mixed learning approaches as a solution (Nazarenko, 2015). Unfortunately, research on mixed learning skills is still limited (Nazarenko, 2015). Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of reciprocal interaction between cognitive styles and mixed learning methods on learning skill achievement. Communication that occurs in online learning is synchronous and asynchronous (Clark and Barbour, 2015). Students and lecturers agree that one of the main weaknesses of online learning is the lack of F2F interaction (Król, 2016). There are three types of cognitive styles: Visual, auditory and kinesthetic (Rhouma, 2016). Kinesthetic students prefer to learn in interactive information media and special situations (Anggrawan et al., 2019). VB. (2016) investigated the link between cognitive styles and student capabilities in learning programming using games. (2017) conducted a study that essentially examined student cognitive styles on academic achievement. Their research results indicate that the student cognitive styles affect academic achievement and each cognitive style has advantages and disadvantages. Their research only focuses on the influence of cognitive styles on student learning outcomes using the survey method in F2F learning  Ceylan and Kesici (2017) examined the effect of mixed learning on student academic achievement. (2019) examined mixed learning intending to improve teacher programming skills. Their research found that student cognitive styles can affect students learning abilities. (2019) examined the influence between cognitive style and gender on mixed learning in Algorithm and programming lesson. Research Methodology This study is experimental research. Learning Treatment Two classes received learning VB.Net Programming courses. Students acquire VB.Net programming skills through F2F mixed learning materials in class and online learning materials. Student cognitive style data were collected using a questionnaire conducted in a mixed learning class. Research Methods Learning skill achievement data in this study is ratio data. Table 2 also shows that in the mixed learning-1 class, the number of students is 50. In the mixed learning-2 class, the total number of students is 50 students. Therefore, the instrument used in this study must meet the validity and reliability requirements of the test. Therefore, this study uses the Levene test to determine whether the learning outcome data is homogeneous or not. Therefore, this study uses Shapiro-Wilk to test the normality of the data. There are differences in learning achievement between students with different cognitive styles in mixed learning-1 and mixed learning-2. Therefore, this study conducted Tukey post-hoc test. error Sig.\n",

Third, the travelled should not exceed a certain distance. Spasovic et al. Geem et al. Sayyah et al. Sghaier et al. The IWD algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm rooted in the driving of river schemes and activities that develop between the water drops in waterway. The IWD algorithm was successfully implemented on different complex optimization problems. Shah-Hosseini (2009) tested the IWD algorithm on travelling salesman problem and obtained near-optimal solutions. Harish et al. Abdulelah et al. The IWD algorithm represents the SBRP in the form of a graph G(N, E). N corresponds to the node set, namely places. E corresponds to the edge set, namely distances between stops. Next, we specify the major steps of the IWD algorithm as explained by Hosseini (2013). Step 1: Initialize static parameters. Step 2: Initialize dynamic parameters. Step 7. Step 8. Accordingly, IWD chooses paths of TTB with less soil on. The major steps of the IWD-algorithm are shown in Fig. 1:  1. In this paper, Initsoil = 1000 and InitVel = 1000.\n",

            " The organizations focus on enhancing the competitive advantage of their product and services (Serrat, 2017). Knowledge transfer is the process of sending knowledge from the knowledge source to the knowledge recipients and acceptance of the transferred knowledge by the recipients (Jasimuddin et al., 2017; Paulin and Suneson, 2015; Sheng et al., 2013). Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of knowledge transfer. Nonaka and Takeuchi (2015) indicated that there are many approaches to knowledge transfer. Knowledge Transfer in Hospitals  Hospitals can be characterized as \"knowledge-intensive\" organizations (Grossi et al., 2019; Dammaj et al., 2016). Figure 2 illustrates the various approaches of knowledge transfer. (2018), Suliman et al. (2018) and Prestmo et al. (2015) argued that the knowledge transferring between health staffs impose best-practices for innovating new medical treatment and medicines. Fig. 1: Schematic representation of knowledge transfer (Kumar and Ganesh, 2009)    Fig. Fig. (2003) and Szulanski (1996). Researchers suggested that missing value must be checked before proceeding to other analyses (Hair et al., 2017). According to Hair et al. (2017), a questionnaire that misses more than 15% of the answers should be deleted. on the other hand, Hair et al. In other words, less than absolute 2 (Pallant, 2016). Also, the staffs highly collaborate between each other to accomplish the health tasks. This indicates that the knowledge transfer is moderate level. Overall, the level of knowledge transfer in the hospital is moderate with 3.07. Also, the variable of ideal knowledge transfer is important to be included in the future works.\n",

            " In this study, we have described our Arabic NER system. So, it causes the Arabic ambiguity (Farber et al., 2008). Also, this led to ambiguity (Alkharashi, 2009) for a computational system. (Shaalan, 2014). Shaalan and Raza (2007) have suggested PERA. The system implementation was within the FAST ESP framework. According to their results, the system obtained satisfactory accuracy. The system has three stages: (1) Morphological pre-processing, (2) examining NEs and (3) applying linguistic rules to obtain unknown NEs. The system includes sports, politics and political economy domains. The system goes through three steps for Arabic person names recognition: (1) Pre-Processing (tokenization, data cleanup and sentence splitting), (2) Automatic NE tagging and (3) Using the grammar rules to extract person names that don't exist within the inherent dictionaries. Benajiba et al. (2007) have built ANERsys. Then (Benajiba et al., 2008) have created another NER system using SVM. The system has been evaluated by utilizing ACE Corpora and ANERcorp. The system has three main stages: (1) Pre-processing which includes (data cleaning, text segmentation and tagging), (2) Arabic Romanization and (3) Using the Artificial Neural Networks classifier for the text.

This research retrained GoogleNet CNN neural network that helps chest CT-Coronavirus medical image classification in early stage. In this section, four neural network architectures are covered (Schmidhuber, 2014). Fig. This is the simplest neural network, as well. Feed forward neural network (Møller, 1993) is an example MLP. In addition to different mapping functions, different regulatory units such as batch normalization and dropout are also incorporated to optimize CNN performance . Figure 2 shows the proposed method. In addition, the preprocessing in this research contains a converting input image and dataset store images from 2D Grayscale to 3D Color:   2D Grayscale to 3D Color The main idea to convert from 2D Grayscale to 3D color is that the CNNs just accept the image with 3D color so that the following MAT LAB function is used for converting. Imbinarize (1) uses a 256-bin     Fig. In addition to the improvement in learning capacity, GoogleNet makes the CNN parameter more efficiently. Third, after retaining GoogleNet, any new input COVID-CT image could be classified. In addition, we suggest doing medical image segmentation as preprocessing step.\n",

Currently, many researchers are still interested in the course timetabling problem. Logic programming methods (Banbara et al., 2013) are also applied. Third, a capacity constraint considers the capacity of the room. Forth, an event spread constraint considers the space between courses. In addition, some constraints are more important than others. However, each constraint is different. For explanation purpose, Fig. This effect is called pruning. Fig. 2. However, each timetabling constraints are of different types. . .

            " Therefore, many researchers specialists in this approach developed the methods that used in cryptography to increase level of security of information exchange and reducing attacks, there are some research that has been using Bézier curves techniques like in (Srividya and Akhila, 2014) use quartic Bézier curve to improve encryption and decryption of data and to lower computational complexity which is depend on Galois field multiplication table. Therefore, in 1958 - 1960 was it the original development of Bézier curve in the cars manufacture by two French scientists Pierre Bézier and Paul de Casteljau. A Bézier curve of degree n is specified by a sequence of n+1 points which are called the control points (Marsh, 1999). Therefore, this curve will not pass through the second point P1 (Armstrong, 2005). ** P1(1) be a point on the piece and defined by (Fig. 1):   (1)    Fig. 1: representation of  P1(1) point. ** P2(2) be a point on the piece and defined by (Fig. 2):   (2)    Fig. 2:  representation of  P2(1) point. ** P2(2) be a point on the piece and defined by (Fig. 3):     (3)   Fig. 3: representation of  P2(2) point on curve. The elliptic curves are more associated with the mathematical than those of RSA and DL schemes (Paar and Pelzl, 2010). Therefore, in this cryptosystem the sender (Alice) and the recipient (Bob) are agree upon publicly an elliptic curve E over finite field Fp and abase point B on E. Bob chooses a secret integer d such that (1 < d < N), where N is the number of points of E and he computes and publishes his public key the point QB = dB Alice wants to send the message M = (m1, m2) to Bob, first she will choose a private random positive integer e such that (1 < e < N) then uses Bob's public key to compute QA = eQB = (k1, k2) and encrypt her message by compute:  c1 = m1 * k1 mod p c2 = m2 * k2 mod p,  where, C = (c1, c2) is cipertext:  Send, {(c1, c2), eB} to Bob. Alice also chooses a secret random positive integer e and uses Bob's public key to compute QA = eQB = (k1, k2) and computes eB. 4) Rewrites as (C, r) as (Cr). for inverse operation, Mult. 2Inv. + 2Mult. Therefore, she will have difficulty for breaking ciphertext C = (c1, c2) because she can't get the following parameters {e, d, BP and t} and to computes and find the session keys (the keys who use to processing in the decryption to find the original message) using d or e and also BP and t (which are also has been consider as the keys) because these parameters are important for attacker to processing and find the original message. Therefore, the proposed method has more secure than the original method. Therefore, the different between them was very small.\n",

There are three mission statements: The institutional mission statement is derived from the institutional vision and describes what is needed to be done to meet the vision; and then the faculty mission and program mission are stemmed from it (Ganu, 2013). The framework consists of four activities: Data collection, data processing, model-driven assessment and evaluation reporting. The framework introduces the data processing in order to extract meaningful information in the evaluation process. jUCMNav facilitates creating, modeling and enhancing complex GRL models. Csorba et al. McGourty et al. The framework also supports a model-driven assessment using GRL goal modeling in evaluating the learning outcomes. The framework also supports generating executive and performance reports that help decision maker in monitoring the institution progress and data necessary for future forecasting. 3. The framework describes a bottom-up process where four activities are defined: Data collection, Data processing, Model-driven assessment and Evaluation reporting. Different kind of surveys are used for that purpose with a motive of assessing the respect to its Missions, PEOs and SOs. The academic portal contains the various details that can be used in data collections, such as statements of learning outcomes and objectives, institutional structure, academic and department objectives, details. There are several methods of analyzing data:    Cohort data where common characteristics of data records based on gender or age  Spatial data where data records are identified based on the physical locations or regions, e.g., ograms within the same faculty  Temporal data where data records are identified based on the periods of time, e.g., analyzing mester within the same program  Multi-level management data where data are identified based on the hierarchal structure of the management in an institution, e.g., analyzing urse, curriculum, program department and faculty levels  Mohammad Alhaj and Ashraf Sharah / Journal of Computer Science 2020, 16 (7): 966.982 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2020.966.982  971   Fig. There are three main groups of concepts in GRL: Intentional elements, such as goal, soft goal, resource, task and belief; intentional relationships, such as contribution, correlation and dependency; and actors, such as User, System and Component.

There are also three assessment tools (KPIs): Assessment1, Assessment2 and Assessment3 are used for evaluating the student outcomes SO1 and SO2.

The framework also does not provide a full automation of data collection, migration, processing and mapping to GRL models. Different format of collected data are migrated, processed and mapped manually.

            " In Ant-Miner, each ant discovers a rule. ACO/PSO2 uses two pruning procedures. Therefore, various neighborhood structures can be developed to catapult the search to another point, which makes it possible to completely utilize the neighborhood. Then, discusses the experimental results of the proposed classifier. Fig. Then, another ant constructs its rule derived from pheromone history. Therefore, the best discovered rule will be kernelled to form the neighborhood structure. ACO/GA is a multi-neighborhood structure algorithm. ACO/GA selects two parent chromosomes (rules). The iteration-best rule represents the FirstParent. 4). In this method, the dataset is split into 10 subsets. These classifiers are considered the most related classifiers in ant-mining literature. Therefore, in the beginning, all rules have the same probability to be selected. These classifiers include the ACO/PSO2 and ACO/SA. Among all classifiers, the ACO/GA achieves the highest results in eight datasets. Table 6 and Fig. Therefore, the ACO/GA dominates the hybridisation with Ant-Miner classifier in all evaluation criteria. Conclusion This study proposes a hybrid Ant-Miner classification algorithm with GA (ACO/GA) classifier.\n",

The model used Nigerian airline passenger data collected for about 32 years from 1975 to 2006. The model produced an average error of about 3% (Tsui et al., 2014). The model was trained using the airline passenger data at the Sao Paulo airport for 21 years from 1990 to 2010. Data from January 1993 to November 2010 and December 2010 to August 2011 were used for training and assessing post-mortem prediction performance, respectively. Data from June 2010 to August 2014 was used and the optimal prediction model used the number of search of 51 keywords before 8 months as independent variables. The model was evaluated through K-fold cross-validation. Data from 1970 to 2013 were used. This is called the ARIMA model. Fig. As shown in Fig. Also presented in Fig. However, Fig. LSTM outperforms other RNN-based models (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). 7. As shown in Fig. 8, LSTM updates the information selectively.

            " Mobile applications (or simply, mobile apps) are increasingly present in our daily lives. The CFM metric is derived from two metrics: Halstead effort and halstead bugs (Halstead, 1979). This metric will compute the number of times a component was called while running the test cases. This metric was adapted from (Ray and Mohapatra, 2012). First, we discuss the prioritization of components. Next, we discuss the component selection works. Ray et al. Mensah et al. (2014; 2016). de Andrade Freitas et al. de Andrade Freitas et al.

In Fig. 7. Fig. Table 5 shows the pre-selected mobile apps. Subsequently, the extraction of the value of the metrics for each mobile app was carried out. Table 7 presents the value generated by the Pearson correlation coefficient; it was extracted from (Rumsey, 2009). The correlation between the Fault Risk (FR) and Market Vulnerability (MV) metrics is likely strong due to the 161 (64.14%) test scripts that failed on all devices and the median failure of the test scripts per device to be 72.51% making the Market Vulnerability (MV) have a value close to 1 (one) for most components, since the value of this metric depends on the devices in which the failure occurred.

Yet, these websites displayed weaknesses in the use of social support features. These researchers applied the PSD model to one e-commerce website, Amazon, to evaluate the persuasive principles. In contrast, only three principles were reported as highly supported by NOON out of the 28. As a result, these applications supported their users to clearly achieve the target behaviors. In contrast, the simulations principle was reported to be the least applied principle in SHEIN and NOON. In contrast, the reword principle was applied the least in ASOS and the liking principle was the least applied in NOON.

            " Fig. A distributed variant of SWORD is presented (Yu et al., 2013a) and named as the Distributed Request Acceptance approach for Fair utilization of Trustees (DRAFT). A distributed trust establishment model for e-commerce applications is presented (Tran et al., 2014) where each trustee builds its own set of models for trustors. Retention of trustors to interact is used as the single criterion, implicit feedback in the trust establishment model presented (Aref and Tran, 2015b). Similar to RLTE, other decentralized models for trust establishment presented in (Aref and Tran, 2016; 2015a; 2017a) use retention of trustors. Aref and Tran (2017b) presented a Multi-Criteria Trust Establishment (MCTE) model. The use of multi-criteria enables checking various contexts and the use of demands and weights can help in context mapping. Recently a distributed, multi-criteria trust establishment model that integrates explicit and implicate feedback presented in (Aref and Tran, 2020b). As with MCTE, the use of multi-criteria enables checking various contexts. 2. The use of weight or importance, in Equation (3) enable varying interpretations of utility gain among agents. The centroid method is a well-known defuzzification method (Pappis and Siettos, 2005). Thus, the same scenario can be simulated using various trust establishment models. At simulation run-time, trustors select particular trustees for interaction based on trust evaluation model. Initially, trustors assume a neutral trust level for every trustee. Nevertheless, RI achieved the least level of (about 80%).\n",

These studies and previous researchers provide insight in three main areas: Privacy and Security, Health and Wellness and Challenges and Obstacles, especially to special needs people. These studies included interviews, surveys and systematic literature review. (Portet et al., 2013). On the other side, some said that it doesn't invade their privacy and it's, in fact, helping them keep the house secure, safe and private. Some sensitive issues include putting cameras inside, not outside the house. Thirdly, talking about how smart houses affect problems. Lastly, all these reviewed studies indicate that smart homes are not perfect. Based on the above, there are a lot of effort to help elder people and special needs to live life independently and make their life easier. Fig. 2). 3). In the interview which done with a specialist who has been dealing with special needs who frequently visit the Handicapped club for many years, there were questions about living in a smart house and it its considered private in an Emirati country. Fig. 4). 5:     Fig. 6. Accordingly, as they were given several choices to choose from, most people chose new technology as the most common challenges they might face. On the other hand, it seems that challenge when living in smart homes (Fig. 7). Based on the answers. 8).

Therefore, some authors have proposed a classification method prior to the encryption  gableh and Basel Alshaikhdeeb / Journal of Computer Science 2019, 15 (11): 1585.1594 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2019.1585.1594  1586 in order to clarify which data is considered confidential to be encrypted. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a comparison regarding security and efficiency of query execution over the cloud. For example, Wang et al. The authors have examined the difficulty of getting accurate results when accommodate searching over a cloud database. For example, Graepel et al. The authors have used a classification technique in order to categorize the data into sensitive and non-sensitive data. Li et al. Therefore, the authors have proposed a verifiable range query processing scheme by enabling the user to verify the completeness. The authors have proposed an Indistinguishable Bloom Filter (IBF) structure in order to index the element. Sahin et al. The authors.

            " Fig. 1. Table 1. 2. Considering that the signal-to-crosstalk beat occurs only when the crosstalk component is in the mark state (bit 1) and assuming that both the mark and absence states have equal probability densities (p (1) = p (0) = 0.5), Equation (6) becomes:  2_(1)RINincNse=- (7)  To evaluate the impact of in-band crosstalk, one must calculate the associated power penalty, which is defined as the increase in the average received power required to maintain a specific BER performance, hence counteracting the in-band crosstalk effect. As stated above, the 3rd term in the right-hand side of Equation (2) represents the out-of-band crosstalk components. For the (N2-N) out-of-band crosstalk component, the mean square becomes22()4pCiNN-. 3. 4. 4. Considering the above yields the following:  ()22222212OOLVwbsss=+ (29)  Substituting Vw= 2swso yields:  ()22222ooDDLlsssss=+º+  where, b2sw = Dsl. Considering this criterion and considering that oFBss=, Equation (30) becomes 1221FFDLBBlss=+given that14TBs=, yielding1221()FTFBDLBBls=+. Considering the above yields:  2222212OOLbsss=+ (34)  From (34),2222222ooOLbssss=+, which is equivalent to222oDsss=+. Figure 5 shows the graphical representation of (15). It represents the power penalty versus the in-band crosstalk for different numbers of in-band crosstalk components (7 and 15 in-band crosstalk components). Figure 7 shows the graphical representation of (25).

            " Fig. 1. Hence, class dynamics has to be addressed. 2. In the proposed scheme the dual encryption uses the key formed by TGECDH for communication within the dynamic peer groups and for communication among the dynamic peer groups which involves ancestor classes the symmetric polynomial scheme (Zou and Bai, 2008) is used. Fig. 2. 3. C3 is the ancestor of C10, C11 and C12. Table 1. 3.3. 3.7. 3.8. 3.9. 4. In the class (e.g., C6), initially two members SixM1& SixM2 are available (Fig. 3). 4), it broadcasts a join request message to class controller. Fig. 3. Member SixM1 and SixM2 join the class    Fig. 4. Member SixM3 join the class  The class controller receives this message and determines the insertion point in the tree. The class controller is the rightmost leaf in the sub tree rooted at the insertion node. Next, the class controller broadcasts the new tree that contains all public keys. The class controller generates a new private key share, computes all public key pairs on the key-path up to the root and broadcasts the new key tree that contains all public keys. Member SixM1™s private key is 1772 and its public key is (290, 638). Member SixM2™s private key is 1949 and its public key is (504, 163), K<1,0> is 1772, BK<1,0>  is K<1,0>*G and K<1,0>*G can be calculated as: K<1,0>*G = (1772 mod 769) G   = 234*(0,376)   =  (290, 638) Similarly, K<1,1> = 1949 BK<1,1> = K<1,1>*G  = (1949 mod 769) G  =  411*(0,376)   =  (504, 163) The Class Key is computed as Member SixM1 sends its public key (290,638) to Member SixM2; the Member SixM2 computes its Class key as:  K<0,0> =  Xco(K<1,1>*BK<1,0>)   = Xco(1772*(504,163))   = Xco(1772*411mod 769)G  = Xco(210,591) = 210 BK<0,0> =  K<0,0>*G   =  210G   =  210*(0,376)   = (540,111) <1,1> = 14755 BK<1,1> = K<1,1>*G  = (14755 mod 769) *G   = 144G = 144*(0,376)    = (623, 52)  Compute the class key:  K<0,0> = Xco(K<1,1>*BK<1,0>)   =  Xco(144*(333,131))   = Xco(144*149G)   = Xco(337,192)  = 337. Member SixM4 Joins the Outer Group When a new Member SixM4 joins the Class, the previous Class controller SixM3 changes its private key value from 14755 to 8751 and passes the public key tree to Member SixM4. Now, Member SixM1, SixM2 and SixM3 compute their class key. 4.4. 5. Member SixM4 joins the class    Fig. 6. 7. 5. Total Storage cost = TGECDHi+Cost for Symmetric Polynomial. 5.2. 5.3. 5.4. In the proposed scheme, only during the changes in hierarchy the key is recalculated by the Central Authority and distributed to the class controllers. In the proposed scheme, asymmetric keys are used between communicating nodes. The class dynamically establishes keys using TGECDH. Table 3.

False positive error is measured in terms of pixel count which removes the error occurrence in FEOC method.

            " (2003) defined Information Culture as a system of shared meanings and knowledge that are enacted through people, processes and technology. To further this, the development of a locally driven Information Culture is the key to sustainable development (Williamson et al., 2001). In a similar definition, Travica (2005) has defined Information Culture in terms of stable beliefs and behaviors. In addition, beliefs have been proved to influence attitude towards behavior (Croll, 2009). In a more detailed discussion of Information Culture advocated by Zheng (2005), seven ways in which individuals experience Information Culture were identified. Knowledge sharing and attitudes toward shared knowledge are also key elements for investigating Information Culture (Curry and Moore, 2003). Knowledge and information behaviours are indicated by ﬁhow individuals approach and handle information (Davenport and Prusak, 1997). Granger (1999) identified four forces which work against developing and sustaining an Information Culture. Plessis (2008), added that the Information Culture in Anglo-American societies differ from that in Africa. Such adoption is also affected by multiple actors that have different backgrounds and interests (Wiley-Paton and Malloy, 2004). Kijsanayotin et al. (2009) stated that the knowledge of how people who  Adnan Mukred et al. The lack of acceptance is a fundamental barrier to the implementation of HISs (Croll, 2009). Table 1. In addition, Mosse (2004) stated that HISs emphasize aspects of humans, technologies, organizational procedures and their inter-linkages. Croll (2009) identified some barriers facing HISs, which include factors such as system failure, cost, fears about confidentiality, security and privacy, inefficiency, poorer quality of healthcare, the change in the work process, complexity of healthcare and lack of acceptance by clinicians. Croll (2009) added that usability is important to the adoption of health information systems. Yusof et al. Yusof et al. Kijsanayotin et al. Yusof et al. 2. 3.\n",

Egfin Nirmala et al. / Journal of Computer Science 9 (9): 1117-1132, 2013  1118JCS used in many surveillance and tracking applications (Drajic and Cvejic, 2007). The fused images obtained by this multimodal fusion, have enhanced information than the individual sensors, which improves detection. Image fusion algorithms are broadly classified into two categories namely, pixel based and feature based. Li et al. (1995) first employed DWT for image fusion. Region based methods are more flexible in adapting to intelligent fusion rules than pixel based approaches (Wan et al., 2009). (2007). Recently, Cvejic et al.

            " According to Wagner (2002) if the software interface is designed without paying attention to users™ ability, it makes users to become confused and creates many difficulties for them to build up a correct conceptual model. According to Nielsen (2003) a good user interface designer has to try to decrease the complexity of software and produce an environment which makes it easy, efficient and enjoyable to work with. 1.1. 1.2. According to findings of Xie (2003) about elder adults™ interactions with computer and the internet, elder people cannot adapt themselves to every user interface design since they do not have any prior experiences in computer from their childhood and learning age, so we should not expect them to learn software like young people with computer background. According to Welie et al. According to Wirtz et al. According to Demiris et al. Dickinson et al. 1.3. These changes will be considered  in user interface design. Table 2. According to Markopoulos and Bekker (2003) Children, like adults, often use the technology to perform their tasks. According to Hutchinson and Bederson (2005) the biggest problem of children is that, all children software are developed by adults and most of them are not familiar with children™s skills and their preferences. According to Nielsen (2010), because children™s interaction with technology is different depending on their age and cognitive ability, so we must distinguish between young (3-5), mid-range (6-8) and older (9-12) children. Grammenos et al. (c) Create interactive user interface by using animation, sound and message boxes. (Norman, 1990; Grammenos et al., 2001). According to the study, they found young children between ages 6-7 are clearly capable of using a computer mouse. According to Fang et al. 1.4. According to Chapman et al. 1.5. (1998) and Chiang et al. Dijana et al. Turunen et al. Giraud et al. 1.6.

            " Data clustering has vast application in data categorization (Memarsadeghi and Leary, 2003),(Velmuruqan and Santhanam, 2010), data compression (Celebi, 2011), data mining (Pizzuti and Talia, 2003), pattern recognition (Wong and Li, 2008), compacting (Marr, 2003), machine learning (Yang et al., 2007), image segmentation (Vannoorenberghe and Flouzat, 2006) and Data clustering importance in various sciences causes the introduction of various methods of data clustering (Hartigan, 1975). Therefore, if initial position of cluster centers in problem space was chosen inappropriately, this could converge to a local optimum. Data clustering is of NP problems. Therefore, first in this method, high convergence rate of k-means is used and after k-means converges, PSO is applied for exiting from local minimums and improving the result of k-means. In the proposed algorithm, first, particles perform optimization process in PSO. b) Cluster center are updated by Eq. 6:   J. To find the optimal cluster centers, PSO algorithm applies Eq. 8 as the fitness function (Tsai and Kao, 2010). Eq. Therefore, for data clustering, PSO algorithm should minimize the fitness function in Eq. Thus, PSO™s objective is to determine cluster centers that are minimizing Eq. 8. Fig. However, PSO™s computational complexity for data clustering is much more than k-means. Therefore, PSO searches globally and as far as it can, it passes local optima. Fig. Therefore, with respect to low computational complexity of k-means, huge amount of computations for local search is prevented. In the proposed algorithm, it has been tried to utilize this conserved computation load for giving new opportunities to PSO in order to perform an acceptable global search in at least one of given opportunities to it. In the proposed algorithm, to determine the convergence of particle swarm, the difference of obtained results in consecutive iterations of performing the algorithm is used. In the proposed algorithm, because PSO and k-means algorithms are performed multiple times, always, it has to save the best found cluster centers by algorithm so far. 2. 8, which calculates sum of intra cluster distances. Eq. Eq. In the proposed algorithm, since it is convenient that PSO performs fast global search and converges, it should use a version of PSO which is of high convergence rate. of No. In the proposed algorithm and PSO with contraction coefficient, c1 = c2 = 2.05 and  = 0.729843788 are considered. Fig. 1 (D = 12). Therefore, the algorithms have to be run 120 times. SICD is calculated, is considered as stop criterion of algorithms. Fig. Therefore, KPSO has less strength in clustering some datasets either. In the proposed algorithm, PSO performs global search and k-means is responsible for local search.\n",

            " These kinds of nodes are known as sensor nodes. Some examples of sensor network applications are as follows (Estrin et al., 1999). By using the intrinsic parallelism of the distributed sensors, multiple objects can be tracked simultaneously. They are coverage and connectivity. Yet, the problem of selecting the smallest amount of sensors is NP-hard. Sensors with unknown location information are called as non-anchor nodes. By using the sensor network localization algorithm, their coordinates can be estimated (Mao et al., 2007). Wang et al. J. Taylor et al. Bai et al. Bai et al. When the chosen set of sensors entirely covers the specified query region, the algorithm finishes. Initially, M is empty. J. Stop the algorithm. J. Faulty sensors may report arbitrary values.

Computer Sci., 8 (7): 1036-1040, 2012  1037 problems, finding an effective solution algorithm does not make sense in the current statement. Consider some examples of such problems. The Hamiltonian cycle problem: Let G = (V, E) is n-vertex undirected graph. Let (R, Q) is a hereditary system. Thus, we have defined a set-theoretic model of a problem of NP. Computer Sci., 8 (7): 1036-1040, 2012  1038 recognition. Therefore, the concept of an admissible solution is broader than the concept of ﬁproofﬂ for the recognition problem. Therefore, we can assume that we have a single-tape Turing machine M. The machine M processes symbols in the cells of the tape sequentially, i.e., symbol by symbol. Thus, the procedure constructing any admissible solution Rj Î Q (j = 1, 2,–, m) is extensive at the time, i.e., its elements are obtained sequentially, element by element. This proves Theorem 1. Therefore, Theorem 2 is true. Otherwise, the problem is called exponential in nature. By the definition of problems without foresight,  J.

In a similar way, the c index for a collaborator-a is defined as: a has index c if a has c collaborators each of whom has given a at least c pure repeated collaborations and each of other (Nc-c) collaborators has provided less than c pure repeated collaboration to a where Nc is the total number of all collaborators of a. J. Hence, this makes it easier to grow than the c index. J. The partner selection method is based on the level of mutual trust between potential collaborators. This allows the collaborator to collaborate in a different level. In a similar way, this selection method supports and promotes such typical social concepts. J. Lastly, we refer to the bell-shaped histogram in Fig. This contrasts with the eBay feedback scores  J.\n",

            " Therefore, information's diversity and user™s disorientation are the main reasons of non-user's satisfaction of e-government services during a search process (Ouchetto et al., 2012). However, the user often does not build a query which accurately reflects his needs because of: (i) the user perspectives and terminological habits (ii) the difficulty of formulating a query, (iii) non-mastery of the vocabulary used by e-gov services and (iv) control's lack of the user's real needs who prefers to look in the long results' lists which do not meet his/her expectations than to look for the appropriate keywords. Afterwards, it calculates the weight of the retrieved services. J. However, Rijsbergen (1979) mentioned that relevance is a very subjective notion. Thus, the probabilistic models were developed. Indeed, they proposed an algorithm for judgment of relevance based on user preferences. However, the acquisition of user profiles in an efficient way remains a challenge. However, these mechanisms have shown their ineffectiveness. They are very uncomfortable for the user As (Sugiyama et al., 2004). Indeed, they can occur in areas of every type and kind which are neither part of its interests or preferences. This method has several advantages. J. 1). Fig. Therefore, the choice of mathematical representation of the query is the important element in this method. Therefore, the queries transformation provides vectors containing both relevant and unnecessary terms. Indeed, the relevant services have a higher weight. Fig. (2011).

Therefore, the function f(x) in the SLR model (Eq. 1) becomes f(xi)T w, where w is the vector of weight parameters. Thus, the Gaussian posterior is written as Eq. Hence, the predictive distribution becomes Eq. 5:  ()()1T2spn1TT2TspsspnpsNKIy,KI--fF+sff-fF+sFf (5)  where, the covariance matrix K is FTpF. Thus, the predictive function value is Eq. 8:  J. The total distance of a tour depends on a chosen starting city (Laporte, 1992). Comparing methods: Classical genetic algorithm (GA): GA is a well-known search heuristic for solving optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution (Chatterjee et al., 1996). It involves three basic steps: evaluation, crossover and mutation. Our GPR algorithm integrates GPR with the Nearest Neighbor algorithm (NN) and the iterated 2-opt method, namely NN+GPR+Iterated 2-opt. J. 2 and 3, respectively. Comparing with GA and SA, the proposed algorithm can find better solutions for 39 TSP instances (out of 60). 2.

Compared to other mobile internet protocols cited in (Kwon et al., 2008), FMIPv6 offers a quicker handover process. In MIPv6, it may take a few seconds to perform handover, but it consumes more time to lose many packets, which is shown in (Kwon et al., 2008; Nguyen, 2008). In the fast  J. Computer Sci., 7 (1): 90-94, 2011  92 handover mechanism, Mobile-initiated Handover (MH) is linked between mobile node™s Previous AR (PAR) (Yang and Chen, 2008) and New AR (NAR) (Yang and Chen, 2008). In response to this, NAR sends Handover Acknowledgement (HAck) message. In MIPv6, minimizing the multicast packet loss is raised by collapse in the handovers. Fig. 1 F-Join operation in FMIPv6  J.

Therefore, there is possibility of use of caching mechanism. Route remains valid until the destination is accessible (Kahn et al., 1999). But if this node does not have any route, it will start route detection process through demand packet distribution. In order to limit the number of publication of route demands, a node process route demands packet only when it has not seen it before that is its address has not been available in section route record. Figure 2, Section (a) shows how route demand packet is distributed in the route and indicates its route record section. Figure 2, section (b) indicates the state in which destination node itself has sent route reply. In order to send route reply packet, the replying node should have a route to origin node. 3. Each node in network can keep 3 Tables. For this purpose, a two- stage method has been selected. For this purpose, route detection and maintenance mechanism are used. In this case, origin node starts detecting a new route to multicast address. Overall, several actions have been improved in new protocol. This led to improvement in DSR protocol.\n",

In this study Fan proposes multi constraint routing based on MAC delay metric, link reliability and throughput constraints. Gupta et al. Lian et al. (Ghazizadeh et al., 2009).

During preliminary admission control, node first checks for bandwidth requirement. On success of the preliminary admission control the node sets up a reverse route entry in its routing table, adds its identifier in the RREQ packet. Then the node rebroadcasts the route request. The destination may get different routes. 2. On success of admission control, a soft reservation of bandwidth is made in the routing table and RREP is forwarded to its immediate predecessor.

            " The routing protocols in MANET can be categorized as proactive and reactive. QAODV (Sinha et al., 1999) is a reactive routing protocol. In QAODV, route discovery consumes more time. TBP (Chen and Nahrstedt, 1999) is a multipath QoS routing scheme. The routing protocol considers free space propagation model (Su et al., 2000). 1. J. According to the first situation, in order to determine whether the nodes associated with a link moves closer to each other or deviates from each other, the calculated CurrentLET is compared with the recent past CurrentLET. Otherwise, if the CurrentLET < recent past LET then the mobile nodes are deviating from each other. According to the second situation, the EL of each node on a link is checked against the EL thresholds EL-TH1 and EL-TH2 where EL-TH1 < EL-TH2. 4 as follows. The Eq. J.

This has led to an increased concern over the role of cancer screening program (Mohd Dom Rosma et al., 2010). 80-90% of oral cancers are caused by tobacco use. These findings are based primarily on the epidemiological association of tobacco use with increased incidence of oral cancer (Madani et al., 2010).

            " Then, the novel adaptive resource allocation algorithm and the computational complexity are described, respectively, in details in Section 5 and 6. Finally, we conclude this presented work in section 8. However, this approach may introduce significant loss in optimality because of its relaxation of the data rate constraints and its high complexity in implementation. Motivated by results proved in (Yu and Lui, 2006), authors Seong et al. However, this is true only in the case of single user systems or multi-users systems with a fixed resource assignment for example in FDMA and TDMA with non-adaptive fixed resource allocation, but, the maximized rate reached by the static resource allocation algorithms using water-filling algorithm is far below the rate that can be achieved by adaptive resource allocation schemes. However, the main inconvenience of max-min approach rises when users  J. To avoid this inconvenience, a proportional fairness allocation strategy is proposed. Obviously, Nknn11=a= when the nth subchannel is allocated and Nknn10=a= otherwise. J. Then, the RU allocation step sort subchannels in descending order for each user. Sorting subchannels in descending order for all users requires then K.Nlog (N). Authors Shen et al. 1: Total spectral efficiency     Fig. 2. J.\n",

If the verifications fail, then the RREQ is discarded by the destination. J. Computer Sci., 7 (12): 1813-1818, 2011  1815  When the intermediate node receives the RREP packet, it checks whether its id is in the list of ids stored by the RREP. If the verification fails, then the RREP packet is dropped. Based on the size, the packets are forwarded. Congestion avoidance: Congestion occurs when a link or node is carrying so much data which reduces the quality of service. Congestion mainly results in packet loss, queuing delay and breakage of links. After packet size verification, the source node forwards the packet to the intermediate node. Computer Sci., 7 (12): 1813-1818, 2011  1816  Thus the algorithm avoids the congestion and balances the load by which link failure is avoided.

EnhancedVegas algorithm: An another approach called EnhancedVegas algorithm for GEO satellite networks is also discussed in this paper to improve the performance of Ad Hoc networks. EnhancedVegas algorithm has more algorithm enhancement than NewVegas algorithm, thus EnhancedVegas algorithm can dispose more complex network conditions than NewVegas algorithm did.

On the other hand, most of the sensor networks™ data compression techniques use statistical correlations between the typically larger data of multiple sensors as they all observe the same phenomenon which make them unsuitable for text compression.

On the other hand, using too few diagrams may have little effect on the overall performance of the compression schema As a result; we only used the 10 most frequent diagrams and trigrams.

Communication and computation performance evaluation metrics for group key management operations  have  been   defined  in  the literature (Zheng et al., 2006; 2007).

            " Consider the object under investigation as ﬁblack boxﬂ with several input variables (inputs) and one output variable (output). GMDH can be considered as further propagation of inductive self-organizing methods to the solution of more complex practical problems (Ivakhnenko and Ivakhnenko, 1995). (Accurate choice of the criterion is separate problem.) (1 corresponds to constant bias and must be always included in the set). (Any one of the tested models is often called partial description or PD). Doing the same for each possible pair of n input variables, we obtain n*(n-1)/2PDs, each with its own value of the used criterion. The values predicted by the preserved PDs (Called Survivors), serve at the next iteration as input variable along with initial input variables of the whole system. On these tiers not more than two processor elements are used, however on the (N1+2)nd tier performed two division operations. Forming these tiers we assumed that the number of checking subsample points N2 is a multiple of 5 (e.g., N2 = 5 m, m is an integer). The minimal height of the algorithm parallel form with the account of two-tier exchange of the first (N1+1) tiers will be 13. On these tiers 240 operations are performed, 127 multiplication and division operations and 113 addition and subtraction operations. J. By entering one divider, the number of tiers increased by 1, so the two division operations on the (N1+2)-nd tier will be computed sequentially.

Computer Sci., 6 (3): 341-349, 2010  342 tune manually all the linguistic, phonetic and prosodic factors which influence the segmental duration in speech. Firstly, the machine learning algorithms which were applied on the phone duration modeling task are described. Finally, we present and discuss the experimental results. In each node, the  J. Computer Sci., 6 (3): 341-349, 2010  343 standard deviation of the output values for the instances reaching a node is taken as a measure of the error of this node and the expected reduction in error is calculated as a result of testing each attribute and all possible split values. This process is applied recursively to all the subsets (Wang and Witten, 1997). Instead of using all the attributes, M5™ algorithm can be applied for feature selection (Wang and Witten, 1997). The error estimation is given by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974). Additive Regression (AR) (Stone, 1985) is a meta-learning technique which enhances the performance of a regression algorithm. J. Computer Sci., 6 (3): 341-349, 2010  344  Moreover the Bagging algorithm (BG) (Breiman, 1996) was used to model the phone duration. In this case, we also applied M5p-R trees (BG-M5p-R) and REPTrees (BG-REPTrees) as base classifiers. The database was designed following this statement, so as for each phone to have multiple instances in various positions in different words (initial, medial, final) in the database. The database which was utilized for the experiments consisted of 62 utterances, which are pronounced several times with different emotional charge. The database, including all five emotional states, consisted of 4.150 words. Various features can be extracted from text for the task of phone duration modeling (Mobius and Santen, 1996; Santen, 1992). J.

Eigenfaces assume ghastly appearance. Turk and Pentland (1991) originally developed face recognition using eigenface techniques. This is called face detection. The eigenface recognition system commonly takes all of the faces and forms a mean face image. The eigenface approach also has problems dealing with facial hair and skin scarring. Combining eigenfaces with eigenfeatures improves face recognition considerably. Belhumeur et al. (2002) describe preprocessing techniques used to improve eigenface face recognition.

            " In mutation, each mutant is a requirement. In combinatorial testing the covering array is a requirement. Testing is more than just debugging. 1. Therefore, it is very clear that combinatorial explosion is a serious issue which has to be considered and software testing always faces the problem of combinatorial explosion. Therefore, one good solution is to construct a test suite with an acceptable number of test cases for any t-way testing (Burr and Young, 1998; Cohen et al., 1997; 2008; Zamli et al., 2007c; Lei et al., 2009). Thus, the tree is constructed iteratively until all the parameters are considered. J. However, it takes more iteration for other samples. 2 explains how the test cases are constructed manually. Therefore, at each stage or iteration we look at the leaf nodes of the tree and generate the next level nodes by considering all the values of the current parameter, to generate the new set of nodes. In the Fig. Therefore, the node (A1, B1) needs to be replicated once. The same is done to (A1, B2). Wmax = N(N-1)/2. 2. Thus, the strategies proposed works well in constructing a minimum number of test cases which covers all pairwise interactions. Therefore, the above strategies proposed have generated an efficient number of test cases that covers all combinatorial pairwise interactions for uniform parametric values.\n",

            " For Mobile Distributed Systems (MDS), causal ordering algorithms are an essential tool to exchange information. 1). Fig. The GMH is subdivided into subgroups (Gl), one for each BS (Fig. 2). Background and definitions: Causal ordering delivery is based on the causal precedence relation defined by (Lamport, 1978). We denote it by ¯ and its formal definition is the following:  Definition 2: Immediate Dependency Relation ﬁ¯ﬂ (IDR):   m ¯ m™Û[ (m ®m™) Ù \" mﬂ ÎM, Ø(m ®mﬂ ®m™)]   Thus, a message m directly precedes a message m™, if and only if no other message mﬂ belonging to M exists (M is the set of messages of the system), such that mﬂ belongs at the same time to the causal future of m and to the causal past of m™. For example, in the serial scenario depicted in Fig. Fig. For example, in the scenario depicted in Fig. 4. To deliver m3, base station BS1 establishes message m1 as lost. Therefore, causal order is ensured at mobile host p1. For example, in Fig. For example, with causal_distance = 2, message m3, shown in Fig. Nevertheless, for the scenario presented in Fig. 3). J. It is a set of entries (i, t, k, DC). (pj)  (pj) È bit_T          9.                 mes_lost(pj) = mes_lost (pj) Œ 1  10. Endwhile 11.         mes_received(pj) = t 12. (pj)  (pj) È bit_T       13.         \" { bit_F } Î  h™(m)     14. Next, the mobile host  p  attaches  h(m)   to  the message m (Line 3, Table 2). J. VT(BSr)[i] = t     8.            \" VT(BSr)[s] = x      endif 10. VT(BSr)[i] = t 11.            \" their lifetime have expired. their lifetime has expired. Afterwards, BS carries out the sending of message bs(m) to the mobile hosts located within its cell. Correctness proof: To show that our protocol ensures the causal delivery (correctness), we provide a correctness proof. J. We denote it by send(pj, ml). Therefore, mk ® ml. Therefore, the d(mk,ml)>causal_distance because bit_Tk Ï h(ml). Step 2:  bit_Tk Î h(ml)  d(mk, ml)  causal_distance   The proof is by contradiction. The proof considers the following case:   · The delivery mk causally precedes to mn (delivery(pj, mk) ® delivery (pj, mn)) at pj. By the step 1, we know that bit_Fk Î h(mn). J. For this proof, we have two general cases. The proof is by induction on the distance d(m0,mn). J. Again, the size of h(m) depends on the number of concurrent messages that immediately precede a message. This behavior has been shown in (Pomares et al., 2004).\n",

            " For classification and action recognition, moment invariants are widely employed (Ahad et al., 2008a) to develop smart feature vector sets. Since its inception, the Hu (1962) invariants became classical. Higher the  J. Computer Sci., 6 (8): 920-927, 2010  921 order for invariants, more noisier and unstable natures they demonstrate. (2008a); Moeslund et al. In another research, for shape analysis and classification of weld defects in industrial radiography, only the first two Hu invariants are employed along with some other geometric parameters (Nacereddine and Tridi, 2005). The first two invariants give measures in relation with the pixel spreading in comparison with the center of mass (Nacereddine and Tridi, 2005). The first   two   moment   invariants were used by Hu (1962) to   represent   several known digitized patterns in a two-dimensional feature space. In another research, Rizon et al. (2006) used only the first invariants for object detection. However, these invariants have several drawbacks. Moreover, in the presence of noise, the computed Hu invariant moments, begin to degrade. This may cause numerical instability when the image size is large (Celebi and Aslandogan, 2005). Moreover, we employ other methods for further analysis. J. Computer Sci., 6 (8): 920-927, 2010  922 MATERIALS AND METHODS   Since its inception, seven Hu moments are widely used. In this study, we employ these templates. To achieve invariance under translation, we need to get central moment. The first four orders (i.e., (p+q) is from 0-3) are defined as:  000010012202011112020233030202212120112121202113030302m0mxmxymym3mx2xmmy2mx2xymmx2my2xym3my2ym=ºmm=m=m=-mm=-mm=-mm=-+mm=--+mm=--+mm=-+m   For the second and third order moments, following seven orthogonal invariants are achieved to calculate feature vectors. The first six moments are rotation, scaling and translation invariants. Computer Sci., 6 (8): 920-927, 2010  923  Based on these seven invariants, for the DMHI and DMEI templates, we need to compute seven Hu moments   for   each   of   the   eight   components. Moreover, to cover the overwriting issue significantly, we introduce the normalized 0th order Hu moments 00()mv. For classification, we consider leave-one-out cross-validation approach. rate (%) 64D 7 + norm. Computer Sci., 6 (8): 920-927, 2010  924  If we consider 7 or 6 or 5 or 4 moments to calculate feature vectors for each history and energy template, we achieve the same recognition rate. 1-5, we use ‚fv™ to denote ‚feature vector number™. Higher the order for invariants, more noisier and unstable natures they demonstrate.

            " Ontologies play a major role in supporting information exchange processes in various areas (Fensel, 2001). Ontologies were best defined by (Gruber, 1993): Ontology is an explicit formal specifications of the terms in the domain and relations among them. Ontologies were developed in Artificial Intelligence to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse. Ontologies applied to the World Wide Web creating what is called the semantic web (Berners-Lee, 2000). General-purpose Ontologies were developed such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and UNSPSC (www.unspsc.org). General-purpose Ontologies contain mistakes in specialized domains (McCrae and Collier, 2008), causing some researchers and applications to construct their own domain-specific Ontology. Ontologies have been used in e-commerce and by many providers such as Amazon (www.amazon.com) and eBay (www.ebay.com) for categorizations of products for sale and their features. Computer Sci., 6 (10): 1070-1077, 2010  1071 where programs can be implemented independent of a product (McGuinness and Wright, 1998). Instead, we try to provide an initial Ontology specialized in education advertising domain. Currently, only a few advertising networks utilize semantic technology. Computer Sci., 6 (10): 1070-1077, 2010  1072 connections for the keyword. Ontologies: In the philosophical domain, the word ontology has been defined as the philosophical study of what exists: The study of the kinds of entities in reality and the relationships that these entities bear to one another (Spear, 2006). In the domain of philosophy, this effort is called ontology. General-purpose Ontologies aim to provide conceptualizations of general notions. However, representations by themselves are not yet Ontologies. Rather, Ontologies have the important further feature of being representational artifacts. Computer Sci., 6 (10): 1070-1077, 2010  1073 was adopted where we started by modeling the ontology first and then using this ontology as a domain model to form the basis of the generation of the Semantic Advertising Network. 1.

            " Events have been chosen as a starting point due to several reasons (a) it is more realistic to use events than processes for requirement analysis and conceptual modeling of event-based systems. (e) Events use a technology-independent stimulus-response modeling technique, while deferring interaction design. Rules are also made to extract a domain model specification (i.e., analysis-level class diagram details) from Event Templates. J. Song et al. Liu et al. Then from event scripts, class diagram components are extracted. Muhairat et al. J. 1. Users interact with the system through events. Values changed in events, give idea of attributes of objects. 1, an Event forms the core of our meta-model. These are basic attributes for an Event class in our meta-model. The Meta-Model identifies five types of events- J. Complex events are aggregation of Simple events. Complex event represents higher level abstraction in the event-based system. Objects play role of actors in an event. Events have a Response associated with it. These are called Changes caused by events. E.g. (e.g., customer places an order). J. Initiator, facilitator or affecter: Initiator starts an event. Initiator, Facilitator and Affecter are different roles that entities/objects play in different events. There can be single Initiator, Facilitator and Affecter in an event. An Event triggers other events in a system. Event-xor indicates exactly one event can be triggered. Event-not indicate non-occurrence (negation) of an event. Hence these operations are described as change-event. Timestamp: Events occur at some point of time. These rules help the analyst in deriving candidate classes, their stereotypes, attributes, relationships and in placing operations in its appropriate class. These rules are applied on a case study (Jalloul, 2004). Role of an entity changes with each event. These stereotypes are: Boundary, Control and Entity. Whenever such events occur, the state of object either gets initialized or destroyed. In case, the change-event is disconnection, it affects the object diagram. Count attribute specifies  J.

            " In order to improve the XML query processing time, the structural relationships between XML nodes must be determined. Thus, the maintenance of the XML document order is very important when update is performed. However, relabeling all of existing nodes is required. Li et al. Li et al. In order to overcome the overflow problem of CDBS, Compact Dynamic Quaternary String (CDQS) (Li et al., 2008) encoding approach is devised which is able to remove relabeling in updating the leaf node completely. In this approach, each XML  J. In order to label the sub-tree, each node in the sub-tree is labeled by new number and then the sub-tree is labeled as a leaf node of the XML tree. Thus, the structural relationship between a node in the inserted sub-tree and other nodes which are not in the inserted sub-tree is determined by comparing the label of sub-tree and the label of other nodes. In order to obtain the structural relationship between nodes in the inserted sub-tree, the new labels which are marked in the sub-tree are used. EXEL (Min et al., 2007; 2009) removes relabeling the nodes for updating. In order to encode N ordinal values, the bit string generation algorithm needs N2[(log)1]+ bits for each bit string. Thus, the total size for encoding N value is N N2[(log)1]+ for example, in order to encode 18 values, the size of the longest bit string is 6 and the total size is 6×18 = 108.

Thus, the proposed algorithm is able to reuse deleted nodes for future binary bit string insertion as well as control the label size.

            " One is the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm, which is based on a stochastic gradient method. The LMS algorithm has been extensively studied and many theoretical results on its transient and steady state performances have been obtained[3]. The LMS algorithm has a computational complexity of O(L), L is the FIR filter length. The RLS algorithm solves this problem, but at the expense of increased computational complexity of O(L2). The FRLS algorithm shows a complexity of O(L). Thus, the complexity of the FNTF falls down to (2L+12P) multiplications instead of 8L. Recently, the simplified FTF-type algorithm[15] developed for use in acoustic echo cancellers. J. Computer Sci., 5 (5): 347-354, 2009  348   Fig.1: Main block diagram of an adaptive filter   In this study, we propose more complexity reduction of the simplified FTF-type algorithm by using a new recursive method to compute the likelihood variable. We describe the NLMS and numerically stable FRLS (NS-FRLS) algorithms. More complexity reduction for simplified FTF-type (M-SMFTF) algorithm is proposed. At the end, we present some simulation results of the proposed algorithms. 1. The filter is updated at each instant by feedback of the estimation error proportional to the adaptation gain, denoted as gL,n and according to:  L,nL,n1L,nL,nwwg-=+e (3)   The different algorithms are distinguished by the gain calculation. Computer Sci., 5 (5): 347-354, 2009  349 normalized Kalman gain vector. The first difficulty comes from L,nL,n10-a=la®. Computer Sci., 5 (5): 347-354, 2009  350 NLMS algorithm, we append a small positive constant ca to the denominator:  L,nL,nL,n1L,n1aeec--®lala+ (13)   The second difficulty is that the forward predictor is locked over its last values. In other words, the algorithm is not well initialised when the signal reappears. Computer Sci., 5 (5): 347-354, 2009  351 this algorithm, we need two likelihood variables: The first one, gP,n , is used to update the forward prediction error variance aP,n, where cP,n is (P+1)th component of L,nk. Computer Sci., 5 (5): 347-354, 2009  352  We can thus say that the system is numerically stable, in the mean sense, for l and h between zero and one. The filter length is L = 256, the forgetting factor is (l = 1-1/L) of the M-SMFTF algorithm. And for RM-SMFTF algorithm, the predictor order is P, the forgetting factor is (l = 1-1/P). Fig. 2: Comparative performance of the algorithms for USASI noise, L = 256. 3: Comparative performance of the RM-SMFTF and NLMS for USASI noise, L = 256.

            " In Fig. In Fig. J. Fig. Each node receives the route requests degree times and the route request propagates far beyond node D. Because nearby nodes will receive and rebroadcast the route request at nearly the same time, contention (when senders can hear each other) and collision(when senders cannot hear each other) will be common. Unfortunately, clear channel assessment does not prevent collisions from hidden nodes. First it allows nodes sufficient time to receive redundant packets and assess whether to rebroadcast. Second, the randomized scheduling prevents the collisions. Thus, having some random nodes not to rebroadcast saves network resources without harming packet delivery effectiveness. Otherwise, it is simply dropped. If true, the node doesn™t rebroadcast. Otherwise, the node assigns a RDT before delivery. For example, say Node A is originating a broadcast packet. Each node in a MANET periodically sends ﬁHelloﬂ messages to advertise its presence. Each node has a unique ID. 3. J. 3: Clustering in MANET. In a cluster, the heads rebroadcast can cover all other nodes in its cluster. Ni et al. Unfortunately, the reachability was unacceptable in low density MANETs.

Computer Sci., 5 (11): 864-877, 2009  867Feature weighting: The problem of feature weighting can be defined as the task of assigning weights to the features that describe the hypothesis at least as well as the original set without any weights. In this study, we apply the feature construction methods to improve the descriptive accuracy of the DARA algorithm. Hypothesis-driven methods construct new features based on the previously-generated hypothesis (discovered rules). GPCI is inspired by GALA, in which GPCI used an evolutionary algorithm to construct features. Fig. This method is also known as a Filter approach, which is showed in Fig. 3. 4), in which new features are constructed within the induction process. This method is also referred to as interleaving[15,16] or the Wrapper approach. Computer Sci., 5 (11): 864-877, 2009  868feature is evaluated by executing the inductive learning algorithm used to extract knowledge from the data, so that in principle the constructed features™ usefulness tends to be limited to that inductive learning algorithm. In this study, the filtering approach that uses the data-driven strategy is applied to construct features for the descriptive task, since the wrapper approaches are computationally more expensive than the filtering approaches. 1) and cross entropy (Eq. 6), to assign a score to the constructed feature.

Multipath routing consists of finding multiple routes between a source and destination node. Multipath routing protocols can attempt to find node disjoint, link disjoint or non-disjoint routes. J. Non-disjoint routes can have nodes and links in common. Disjoint routes offer certain advantages over non-disjoint routes. Disjoint routes also provide higher fault-tolerance. Thus, node disjoint routes offer the highest degree of fault-tolerance. SMR algorithm only selects two routes. AOMDV can be used to find node-disjoint or link-disjoint routes. To find node-disjoint routes, each node does not immediately reject duplicate RREQs. Also, duplicate RREQ packets are not discarded by intermediate nodes. 2.

The MOBIC forms 1-hop clusters, whereas MobDHop can be extended to multihop clusters. Thus, the time complexity of MOBIC is £(Tsample+1). Thus, the role of the cluster head in WCA is retained as long as its weight is lower than the neighborhood member nodes and its lifetime is low than the other two protocols. Thus, both Max-Min and channel access based protocols provides moderate cluster head lifetime. In WCA, average number of cluster head change increases when the mobility of the cluster head increases. Thus, the cluster head change is moderate than the other two protocols. J. Thus, the time complexity cannot be bounded and may vary noticeably for different network topologies.

            " However, these requirements have led to a huge variety of hardware components, making wireless sensor networks hardware not only modular, but also heterogeneous. The need for connectivity, hardware abstraction and management of limited resources makes operating system support imperative for sensor network applications. As such, the nodes will have limited processing power  J. Many of these operating systems provide and thus require hardware support to, memory protection. However, the most prominent of these systems are the TinyOS[7], MANTIS OS[1] and SOS[5] systems. Depending on the architecture, context switching may be a lengthy operation. However, the system is still adequate for use in current sensor network prototypes. Underneath this communication API, MANTIS uses traditional device drivers. However, this overhead is still acceptable for most sensor network applications[5]. This semantic abstraction of sensor readings promotes application portability. J.

            " Developments in information technology have helped governments to improve their services to their citizens. Due to the nature of news and media organizations, the information technologies have particular relevance to them. Developments such as the Internet and satellite television have created new medium and audiences through which and to which these organizations can disseminate their information. As information technology has developed over the past years, educational establishments have been influenced in various ways. Information technologies have enabled researchers to access a wider source of information than previously available through such technologies as the Internet. Information is a key factor to any development process. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have changed the way information is stored, disseminated and processed. Information is central in areas of social, economic and political activities. Communication specialists view development as knowledge based. Development is achieved through the acquisition of information, education and skills that empower individuals to make choices and exercise control over their environments in order to work for the improvement of existing conditions. Development must be based on economic independence, co-operation and fair competition between nation-states. Information, education, science and technology the most critical sources of value in the Internet-based economy. J. Virtual organizations are linked by information technology to share skills, costs and access to one another™s markets.

The constituents of a complex system are interdependent. Consider the case of a government, which is an example of a complex system. There are different levels (scales) in the government: local (city corporations or municipalities), state and the union government. For the brain, billions of neurons interact to yield complex behavioural patterns. Complex systems show global coordinated behaviour, without the presence of any distinct global controller. There is another property of complex systems worth discussing. In all these organizations, complexity involves interplay between cooperation and competition. J. Typical examples include ant colonies, immune systems, brain, markets and companies. Foresight horizons can be clear, complicated or complex[29]. J. The only answer is to make the Information Systems more flexible and adaptive, i.e. model them as Complex Adaptive Systems. The IS strategist, therefore, needs  to have a complex foresight horizon. This categorization might be in terms of the information systems development methodology that we adopt, e.g. the waterfall model. 2. There are responses from interested individuals about fixing the bugs. 3. J. There are two types of factors which control the various patterns of interaction. There are four classes of behaviour in any Complex Adaptive System, viz. Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV models (systems).

            " Zhang et al. Shot segmentation: A shot is defined as the consecutive frames from the start to the end of recording in a camera. Finally, the statistic feature is considered as the fifth. However, this system was presented for detection of cut-type shot boundaries. The motion feature detects motion of objects between frames. This method uses possibility values produced from different thresholds to measure the degree of possibility of a cuts presence. Histogram based detection: Colin et al. [18], present a detailed evaluation of a histogram-based shot cut detector. A low cosine value indicates similarity. Shot segmentation by graph partitioning: Cernekova, et al. The method relies on evaluating mutual information within a certain temporal frame window. The method is able to  J. [25]. This method is easy to use and fast. In such applications, camera motion is normally canceled by  J. For these videos, camera motion is always an essential cue for retrieval. The proposed approaches that employ clustering structure for retrieval include [28,30,31]. For instance, Ngo et al. However, the operation of such systems is highly technical. Candid [53]. Shannon et al. Ferman et al. [57] and Naphade et al. Vasconcelos et al. [59] have integrated shot length along  J. Recently, many researchers have worked in semantic image classification and natural image database organization into categories like Indoor vs. For instance, Tan et al. Recently, Dagtas[71] further presented various trajectory and trail based models for motion-based video retrieval. Initially, all frames in a shot are viewed as a curve. Video is then annotated  J. This query string is rendered as an image and the corresponding set of features is extracted. Pseudo-relevance feedback: Yan et al. Following this direction, we used a classification-based Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) approach. This query is posed against a video collection. Negative Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (NPRF)), to improve the performance of content-based video retrieval. In this work, the task of video retrieval is framed as a concept classiÞcation problem. Most of them are good, but hard to verify. However, there are also considerations intrinsic to retrieval systems.\n",

Fig. Clustering based on Self-Organizing Map (SOM): Preprocessing and Transformation: One of the biggest challenges of data mining is the comprehensive nature of the quality of data. Clustering: Data elements with high similitude are bunched up within same cluster while data elements with less similarity are crowded up in different clusters. Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns into groups. Clustering is the method of grouping objects into meaningful subclasses so that the members from the same cluster are quite similar and the members from different clusters are quite different from each other [9]. Clustering gradually discovers the data and institutes maximum possible number of groups, albeit the process commence with spur-of-the-moment regarding the number of groups present.

            " 1. Fig. 2. Status of layer 1: Unicode is developed by the Unicode Consortium. Status of layer 2: XML is developed by the World Wide Consortium. RDF Schema is a simple modeling language introducing classes of resources, properties and relations between them[24]. Status of layer 3: RDF model and syntax became a W3C recommendation in 1999, while the complete version for RDF was presented in 2004 as a W3C recommendation consisting of six documents: they are RDF/XML syntax specification, RDF vocabulary language, RDF primer, RDF concepts and abstract syntax, RDF semantics and RDF test cases[32]. Status of layer 4: There are several ontology languages which are related to the Semantic Web. Status of layer 5: Up to now, there is no established technology for this layer and is still as a research topic in the World Wide Web Consortium. This will be a useful Semantic Web service. Status of layer 6: The proof concept is still under research. There is no established technology for this layer. Layer 7: Trust: A lot of efforts have been exerted to reach the trusted web, but this is very complicated and difficult task and has not become a reality. Trust has many meanings in the Semantic Web. Trust is the final layer in the Semantic Web architecture. Status of layer 7: There is not much written about this layer nor is there a technology recommended by the W3C to perform this task. J. Status of the digital signature: XML Digital Signature became a recommendation by the W3C in 12 February 2002[41]; a second edition was presented on 10 June, 2008[41]. There is a relation between Logic, Trust and Proof layers. There is not much written about these three layers, but they are considered as the most difficult challenges facing the Semantic Web. Status of layer 4: The available ontology languages at that time were OIL, DAML and DAML+OIL, but none of them was considered as a W3C recommendation. Status of Vertical layers: The status of this layer can be concluded as follows: the work in XML Encryption started by W3C in 2000[49] and became a W3C recommendation on 10 December 2002[48]. J. Figure 4 shows version three of the Semantic Web architecture. Status of layer 4: OWL is included in the Semantic Web architecture as the ontology language recommended by the W3C in 2004 and compatible with RDF and RDF Schema, while Rules are still as it is in V2, but became a separate layer next to OWL not above it.

Furthermore, some DNA strands or sequences could be wasted because of the undesirable reactions. DNA sequence design: In DNA computing, perfect hybridization between a sequence and its base-pairing complement is important to retrieve the information stored in the sequences and to operate the computation processes. Seeman et al. [9,10] designed sequences using overlapping subsequences to enforce uniqueness. Hartemink et al. Furthermore, Tanaka et al. Marathe et al. Feldkamp et al. Frutos et al. Deaton et al.

The particles change their state by ﬁflyingﬂ around in an n-dimensional search space based on the velocity updated until a relatively unchanging state has been encountered, or until computational limitations are exceeded.

            " In 1-D recursive filters, determination of stability is quite straightforward. Therefore testing of 2-D recursive filters for stability is extremely cumbersome.

Numerous approaches can be found in the literature for testing the 2-D recursive digital filters for stability[5,6-9,11,12,14]. Theoretically, only algebraic methods  J. However, there are some difficulties which limit applications of algebraic methods. In algebraic methods, the stability tests rely on certain algebraic properties of complex polynomials. Huang developed the first algebraic procedure[12] to test the stability conditions based on double bilinear transformation and Ansell method. In[15], an improved stability test algorithm for two-dimensional digital filters is discussed. In[8], a computationally simpler algebraic procedure is proposed. This requires a 4-D search. To satisfy condition (2), we require a 2-D search. In De-Carlo-Strintzis™ Theorem, three 2-D searches are required[4]. Huang developed the first algebraic procedure for testing stability conditions. Testing the  J. However, this procedure too is still infinite. [5], the computational complexity is further reduced. Bose test requires approximately O(6M4) operations.\n",

            " In  J. Computer Sci., 4 (12): 1012-1019, 2008  1013 practice, however, unit test cases are invariably constructed manually by a tester who may need to spend significant time analyzing the program under test. In practice, mutation analysis subsumes branch coverage. This module uses a dynamic, search-based approach to software test generation [3-8]. 1. An  J.

Computer Sci., 4 (12): 1012-1019, 2008  1015 dependency graph can be constructed by traversal of the abstract syntax tree[10]. Object-oriented specific mutations[11] are not implemented. In general, for mutation testing, the tool does the following:  · Produce mutants · Randomly generate test input · Run all mutants that have not been killed with some test input t, deciding which of these are killed to t · State which mutants have yet to be killed  Test data search framework: The problem of taking a given program and constructing an input that produces a given program behaviour, is well known to be undecidable. Computer Sci., 4 (12): 1012-1019, 2008  1016 that is used to search for test data. This is survival of the fittest. In general, the population structure of a single genetic algorithm is a tree. Details are in[16]. In general, multi-population genetic algorithms may allow individuals to ﬁmigrateﬂ from one population to another. In the tool, the migration of test cases between populations is unrestricted. J. Computer Sci., 4 (12): 1012-1019, 2008  1017  Thus, for string equality we use the binary Hamming distance, character distance, edit distance and string ordinal distance, while for string ordering, the ordinal value method and single character pair ordering is applied.

            " Furthermore, TTP/C is designed to provide an acceptable level of fault tolerance. Furthermore, it will always remain at least two non faulty processors in the system. If so, p can conclude that its broadcast was successful. Otherwise, either p is failed to broadcast or q is receive-faulty. Therefore, p removes itself from the membership set and by not broadcasting its message, p can inform the other processors about its failure. Formally, the group membership algorithm is described by a set of guarded commands. In every slot t, every processor executes exactly one of these commands. The formal description involves two additional boolean state variables, prevtp and doubttp. Finally, the clauses (15) to (20) comprise all other receiving processors. In a normal situation, the processor that is the broadcaster in the current slot executes the clause (1). Therefore, the processor can finish the acknowledgment process and reset the prev and integrat flags to false. Moreover, because the last message was accepted, the accpt counter is increased. Therefore, the processor can finish the acknowledgment process, inserts the current broadcaster in its membership, resets the prev flag to false and increases corresponding counter. Thus, the main part of the proof can be represented as a configurations diagram. The diagram for the group membership algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. The diagram can be developed step-by-step. For TTP, this central configuration is the one labeled stable. Moreover, stable is the initial configuration of the system. The expression recent (t, z) denotes that at time t, processor z is the recent non-faulty broadcaster. Thus, the non-faulty processors remove x from their membership sets by executing the command (19) or (9) in the case of z. Therefore, all non-faulty processors have the same membership sets.

            " Finally, agent mobility hides network specifications from developers. However, mobile agent-based architectures are not widely deployed in commercial applications. Generally, the mobile agent systems subdivide security problems into two different parts. Therefore, mobile agents must be provided with some protection mechanisms to prevent these attacks. The mobile agent code is divided into several fragments. Certain fragments are not transported by the mobile agent, but implemented within the RTP. J. Crypto. Three mechanisms are implemented within a mobile agent to protect data. The cooperating agent is called sedentary as it moves only once from the origin platform (O) to the trusted third platform (T), as shown in Figure 1. The mobile agent code is split into two parts. This platform must execute the code correctly. The mobile agent does not transport any private keys. J. The Output() message contains the results obtained by the mobile agent on platform Pi. In both cases, the mobile agent continues its itinerary to the next platform. J.

            " When performing anaphora resolution, all noun phrases are typically treated as potential candidates for antecedents. Anaphora resolution requires multiple sources of knowledge. Their method has been applied to personal pronouns, reflexives and possessives. The second part, the anaphora resolution procedure, applies the constraints and the preferences. The preferences used in our system are: syntactic parallelism, antecedent not included in a prepositional phrase, focused expressions and recency. Consistency conditions are agreement on morphological grounds (gender, number and person). The preferences incorporated are: 1. Candidates in the focus register (preference(1)) 2. Syntactic parallelism (preference(2)) 3. Algorithm design Recognition phase  1. Recognition of non anaphoric pronouns 3. Identification and elimination of appositives 4. Identification of focusing expressions, updating the focus register 5. 1. Remove from E noun phrases from sentence (i-3) 2. These pronouns are frequent in literary texts.

If we choose  out of this stroke, the protocol will be automatically stopped (efficiency problem). These limit-values are function of depolarizing parameter (Fig.5).

In addition to that, we determine the secure information immediately. The probability p(max) = max can define the protocol efficiency. This efficiency is function of p; it decreases by increasing p (for p  0.75). Indeed, we obtain p(max) =1. In addition to that, this information (knowing p-value) increases the possibility of having more secret after error correction [13].\n",

            "An Air Traffic Controller (ATC) system aims to manage airline traffic to prevent collision of the airplane, called the Collision Avoidance (CA). The study on CA, called Conflict Detection and Resolution (CDR), becomes more critical as the airline traffic has grown each year significantly. Previous studies used optimization algorithms for CDR and did not involve the presence of cumulonimbus clouds. Many such clouds can be found in tropical regions like in Indonesia. Therefore, involving such clouds in the CDR optimization algorithms will be significant in Indonesia. We developed a CDR-based CA modelling that involves the Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds by considering three airplane maneuvers, i.e., Velocity, angle Turn and Altitude level Change (VTAC). Our optimization algorithm is developed based on a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solver due to its efficiency. This proposed algorithm requires two input data, namely the initial airplane and cloud states input and the flight parameter such as velocity, angle and altitude levels. The outputs of our VTAC optimization algorithm are the optimum speed, altitude and angle turn of an airplane that is determined based on the currently calculated variables. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed approach and the experiment results show that collisions between airplanes and clouds can be avoided with minimum change of the initial airplane velocity, angle and altitude levels. The VTAC algorithm produced longer distance to avoid collision between airplanes by at least 1 Nautical Mile (NM) compared to the VAC algorithm. The addition of angle in the VTAC algorithm has improved the result significantly.

            "Collision avoidance on air traffic becomes very important to be investigated as the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system aims to increase the safety of the airplane passengers. The Collision Avoidance (CA) has been studied in many researches on Detection and Resolution (CDR). The general solution for CA uses three types of manoeuvres on an airplane, namely speed, altitude and angle of direction of flight. The aim of the CDR is to create a standard procedure to help the airplane controller and pilot when action to prevent conflicts is not successful. For example, when two or more airplanes violate the specified safety criteria to maintain the minimum horizontal distance between airplanes by 5 Nm or the minimum vertical distance by 1,000 ft. This criterion is referred to as the Protected Zone (PZ). The proposed solution must be able to maintain a predetermined flight schedule.  One solution to this problem is to consider speed and altitude manoeuvres. The model that uses this solution is called the Velocity and Altitude Change (VAC) model proposed by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2011). The proposed method uses the geometry construction and the Velocity Change (VC) model introduced by (Pallottino et al., 2002). The proposed VAC model uses a Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization (MILO) approach VAC aims to find the optimal speed and altitude so that an airplane avoids pre-defined conflict criteria as well as to minimize the change of flight schedules. Pallottino et al. (2002)  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  34 proposed a VC model using the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method. Alonso-Ayuso et al. (2011) then enhanced this model by adding anomaly cases and false conflicts. The anomaly cases are used to detect the zero-divisors in the geometry construction while the false conflict aims to identify if two airplanes move to opposite directions. An alternative solution is also produced using the height manoeuvre variable. Alonso-Ayuso et al. (2011) created groups of airplanes based on altitude levels with 1,000 ft distance between the groups. The Altitude Change (AC) proposed by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2011) considers the detection of a pair of airplanes towards each other, a head to head situation. Alonso-Ayuso et al. (2012) proposed a MILO model that not only considers VC but also takes into account the acceleration factor to avoid instantaneous changes. The research modified the native VAC by considering Coordinated Velocity and Altitude Changes (CVAC) based on MILO models. This model did not include CDR problems. A Mixed-Integer Non-linear Optimization (MINO) model for handling the CDR problems (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) is proposed. The proposed MINO model produces high accuracy but requires a high computational cost. Another scheme enhanced the MINO model with an additional three airplane manoeuvres variables, i.e., Velocity, angle Turn and Altitude level Change (VTAC). The enhanced model requires less computational cost, called the Sequential Mixed-Integer Linear Optimization (SMILO), in a trade-off of a slightly lower accuracy (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a). The optimization models in the previous studies did not involve the presence of cumulonimbus clouds. In fact, many cumulonimbi can be found in tropical countries, e.g., Indonesia. Cumulonimbus clouds are a tall, dense cloud type that tends to grow vertically rather than horizontally. This cloud is formed due to water vapour carried by very strong upward air currents. The cumulonimbus clouds are very dangerous since they can cause an airplane to experience turbulence and even can cause the engine to fail. An optimization model that involves the cumulonimbus cloud is important to avoid collisions with such clouds. Research in (Purwananto et al., 2019) presents a heuristic approach using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to avoid conflicts between the planes and simulate the cumulonimbus cloud to be avoided by a plane. However, the experimental results are not shown in detail. In this study, we develop an optimization model to enhance the proposed optimization model by   (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) to solve CA problems and VTAC airplane manoeuvres by considering the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds. We use the SCIP Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solver (Gleixner et al., 2017) due to its computational efficiency.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The review of research is presented in section 2, the methodology of our research is presented in section 3, experimental results are presented in section 4 and finally, the conclusion is presented in section 5. Related Work Collision-Conflict Avoidance is divided into two categories, namely Conflict-collision Detection (CD) and Collision Resolution (CR). CD is the process of detecting conflicts between two or more airplanes or between an airplane and some obstacles in the airspace, while CR is a decision or solution for the completion of the CD solution. As an illustration, suppose there are two airplanes in the same horizontal plane. Each airplane has a flight plan consisting of a sequence of points for each time t at speed v. An airplane can detect a potential conflict to the other airplane by using TRACON (a radar approach control terminal). If the airplane detects the presence of the other airplane within 5 nm outside of TRACON and 3 nm inside TRACON, then the situation is classified as unsafe. Another criterion of flight safety is the vertical distance of airplanes should be at least 5 nm or 1,000 ft. The research in (Kuchar and Yang, 2000) was known as the first study on Conflict Detection and Resolution (CDR) problem. The research used a mathematical optimization approach to solve the problem. Then, (Martín Campo, 2010) used a similar approach and offered various methods and algorithms to solve the collision avoidance problem. A survey of intelligent transportation systems in (Zhang et al., 2011) presented models used to solve airline conflict problems. Then, efforts are conducted to improve the models by using optimization algorithms for conflict avoidance by involving variations in speed, direction, altitude and the possibility of returning to the starting point of flight. Research in (Shi et al., 2012) was enhanced by adding a predictor of air traffic density and its implementation in airplane lane planning. The research was developed based on a simplified stochastic differential equation model of airplane dynamics, as demonstrated in (Albasman and Hu, 2012). Metaheuristic algorithms are also used for CDR problems. For example, the Ant Colony algorithm (Durand and Alliot, 2009; Meng and Qi, 2012; Gao et al., 2012) were used for decision-making angle Turn (TC) manoeuvres. The Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2015) that considers possible influential factors to the TC problem was developed in (Omer and Farges, 2013) that used a combination or hybrid method to solve the same problem. The use of linear approach also produced satisfactory results, such as the Neural Network approach for the Velocity Change (VC) manoeuvres problem (Cetek, 2009; Christodoulou and Kodaxakis, 2006; Durand et al., 2000). A linear approach based on Taylor iterative  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  35 polynomials was proposed by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2012), which then resumed in (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) by using the Sequential Integer Linear Optimization (SILO) method. Linear and metaheuristic approaches are well known due to their computational efficiency. The trade-off of the approaches is that there is no guarantee a global-optima solution and sometimes even a feasible solution, is found. A non-linear approach is used to build a mixed 0-1 non-linear model to solve the collision avoidance problem (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2010; 2012). The non-linear approach is applied for optimization algorithms with mixed-integer that involved trigonometry and non-convex equations (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016). The approach offered horizontal and vertical manoeuvres. A two-stage approach, namely angular deviation and mixed 0-1 non-linear model calculations, was used in (Cafieri and Omheni, 2017) to avoiding air traffic conflicts. The approach implemented gradual changes in heading angles and heights. Research in an unmanned airplane was initiated in (Smith et al., 2013) that proposed an optimization on airborne collision avoidance. Further research in this field (Foina et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017) developed a geometric conflict resolution method for distributed cooperative drones. The study focused on calculating the safe separation boundary from a pairwise drone. The non-linear tangent function to safely separate the drones is transformed into a linear boundary by mapping the relation into the sin value space. Search And Rescue (SAR) airplanes pose a unique challenge as they often perform their operations in low-altitude. This condition requires different modelling, given that flying in low-altitude is very prone to collisions. Research in (Zhang et al., 2017) proposed solutions to this problem using a standard aviation visual separation model. The study was divided into two sub problems: A pairwise and many planes. Conflict scenarios are divided based on the path of the airplane and the mission carried. The outcomes of the solutions are decisions to fly higher, to change lanes and or to change speed. In general, there are three classifications of periods for providing solutions to the CDR problem: Long, medium and short terms. The division is based on the time period of when a solution to a problem is issued, for example, 20 to 60 min for the long term, 5 to 20 min for the medium term and 2 to 5 min for the short term, respectively. The short term solutions were initially researched in (Shakarian and Haraldsdottir, 2001) and then further enhanced by (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a). The study in (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) was developed using multi-objective optimization-based techniques, which demonstrated that the metaheuristic approach is efficient. The state-of-the-art to solve the CDR problem with the use of a non-linear optimization algorithm is the MINO model (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) using the Minotaur solver (Mahajan et al., 2020), while the use of sequential mixed integer optimization SMILO model (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) using the CPLEX solver (IBM, 2015). CPLEX is also a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solver. Both algorithms are well known due to their good performance in solving the CDR problem. The SMILO model requires less computational cost, in a trade-off of a slightly lower accuracy than MINO model. However, they do not cover the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds in their modelling. Many of cumulonimbus clouds can be found in tropical countries, where this dense cloud type tends to grow vertically rather than horizontally. The CB clouds are very dangerous as they can cause an airplane to experience turbulence and even can cause the engine to fail. An optimization model that involves the CB cloud is important to avoid collisions with such clouds. Research in (Purwananto et al., 2019) presents a heuristic approach using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to avoid conflicts between the plane using SMILO model and simulate the cumulonimbus cloud to be avoided by a plane. However, the experimental results are not shown in detail. In this study, an enhancement of the MINO optimization model is proposed to solve CA problems and VTAC airplane manoeuvres by considering the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds. We use the Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solver SCIP (Gleixner et al., 2017) due to the computational issue of MINO. Methodology Our air traffic model is the extended version of VTAC model (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b) to solve CA problem by considering the presence of Cumulonimbus (CB) clouds. The aircraft can perform three types of maneuvers to avoid conflict situations: Changes in velocity and angle turn (horizontal maneuvers) and changes in altitude levels (vertical maneuvers). The Velocity Change (VC) allow Airplane to Change the velocity for avoiding the collision. The altitude change (AC) considers the detection of a pair of airplanes towards each other, a head to head situation. The two types of inputs are needed such as the pre-processing parameters (meters) and Cumulonimbus (CB) cloud parameters. The outputs are the optimal velocity, angle turn and altitude level that meet the requirements for avoiding collisions.  Set Definition  Sets Details F Set of plane and Cumulonimbus (CB) cloud  P Set of pairs plane-plane and cumulonimbus-plane that have conflict potential Z Set of altitude level. CB clouds have fixed altitude level.

This variable can be divided into 2 nonnegative variables  and  f Variation of angle to avoid conflict situations. This variable can be divided into 2 non-negative variables  and   A non-negative integer variable which is the value of altitude level that is allowable for a plane to climb  Non-negative integer variable which is the value of altitude level that is allowable for the plane to descend Output Parameters For every plane and CB cloud fF, the output result is in the following:   Optimal velocity,    Optimal angle turn,   Optimal altitude level, z:fz = 1  Constraints The CDR constraints are as follows: For every plane and CB cloud fF:   (1)  For every pair of planes {i, j}P and zZ:   (2a)   (2b)   (2c)   (2d)   (2e)  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  37  (2f)   (2g)   (2h)  In order to detect and solve the conflict situation, the set of constraints Equation (2) are used. The pathological situations are avoided in the model since each constraint is controlled by parameter pcij. The pcij is set to 1 in the pre-processing phase if there exists a pathological situation between plane i and j. For every pair of plane and CB cloud {i, j}P and zZ:   (3)  Constraint Equation (3) forces the following situations: (a) only one of the four possible cases in the geometric construction for the horizontal maneuvers (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) in the pair of plane and CB cloud, (b)  which forces the case in which two planes or CB cloud fly at different altitude levels, so there is no longer potential conflict situation between them. For each plane and CB cloud fF:   (4)  The constraint Equation (4) imposes that each plane and CB cloud must fly at only one altitude level. For every pair of plane and CB cloud {i, j}P and zZ:  (5)  The constraint Equation (5) splits the two values for -variables. For , it forces a situation in which only one aircraft or CB cloud (i or j) can fly at altitude level z at most. For , the constraint is inactive, which means that the constraint Equation (2)-(4) determine the altitude level at which the separation maneuver is made for both plane and CB cloud if any (either at the same altitude level or at different altitude levels). For each plane fF:   (6a)   (6b)  The zf is the initial configuration for plane f constrained by Equation 61-6b (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a). The variable, f, in the equations count the level's numbers by which plane f simultaneously update its altitude. The variables  and  are related with the initial altitude level of each aircraft. The Equation (6a) and (6b) counts the number of altitude levels between the new configuration and the initial one. If the plane has changed its initial altitude level then only one of the two constraints is greater than 0, thus satisfying the non-negativity requirement for variable . Observe then that the objective function Equation (10) (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016a) forces a weighted sum of variables . For each plane and CB cloud fF:   (7a)   (7b)   (7c)   (7d)  For each plane and CB cloud fF and zZ:   (7e)  For every pair of plane and CB cloud {i, j}P and zZ:   (7f)  For each plane and CB cloud fF:    (7g)  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  38 Finally, the constraint system Equation (7a)-(7g) defines the range value of the variables. The geometric construction might change some initial configurations of plane even if they are not involved in a conflict situation (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b). These cases are called false conflicts since two aircraft, i and j, are moving away from each other, the geometric construction forces them to perform unnecessary maneuvers to avoid conflict situation. It also needs to consider those cases in which two plane, i and j, are flying at different altitudes with a horizontal distance of less than the minimum required, usually 5 nm (Alonso-Ayuso et al., 2016b). The parameter forces the two planes involved to fly at different altitudes since otherwise, they are in conflict.  In order to solve the conflict over possible collision between plane and plane, or plane and CB cloud, some maneuver such as horizontal maneuver (velocity and angle changes) and or vertical maneuver (altitude level changes) must satisfy the three objective functions as Equation (8) and (9):   (8)   (9)   (10)  Experimental Environment We conducted our experiment using the Software framework for Constraint Integer Programs (SCIP) optimization suite (Gleixner et al., 2017). SCIP is known due to its very efficient yet accurate in solving the VAC and the VTAC problems. SCIP uses a branch and bound approach complemented with the Linear Programming (LP) relaxations and cutting plane separators to solve Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) and Satisfiability (SAT) problems. A problem instance is continuously divided into two sub-problems until it is infeasible to do so. At this point, an optimal solution for the sub-problem can be identified. The LP relaxation of a sub-problem is obtained by dropping the integrality restrictions of the n be solved more efficiently and provides a dual bound on the objective value. The dual bound is then used for the bounding step in the initial branch-and-bound algorithm. Once the LP relaxation of a sub-problem is obtained, SCIP exploits the integrality restrictions to tighten the relaxation and thereby improve the bound obtained. The safe distance is measured in NM (Pallottino et al., 2002). We run our experiment in a considerably small area of 120×120 NM to mimic a very condense flight area where collisions occur. Experimental Scenario We used six airplanes flying on the same altitude with given X-Y coordinates and angles (see Table 1). We used a range of [3,5] speed where normally airplanes that fly on the same level are of the same type with a similar speed profile. We set the minimum safety distance between airplanes at 2.5; Nm considered as the safe distance (Pallottino et al., 2002). We run our experiment in a considerably small area of 120×120 NM to mimic a very condense flight area where collisions occur. In the first experiment, we optimized the route of every airplane by using VAC and VTAC algorithms. The algorithms provide recommendations to maintain or change the speed, angle and or altitude of every airplane when a potential collision is detected. In the second experiment, we included a dynamic cloud in collision avoidance modelling (Table 2). Although a cloud can be seen as a native aerial object (such as an airplane), however, the dynamic pose a different challenge to the modelling. The characteristic of a cloud that could lay on several altitude levels restricts any objects (such as airplanes) to go across the cloud. In addition, the diameter of a cloud is far wider than an airplane. Thus, the safety distance is defined as the flight safety radius + the radius of the cloud on every altitude level. Based on the speed, direction and altitude of the airplanes, we simulated the position of the airplanes in ten iterations. We record the airplane coordinates during the simulation that form airplane tracks. A unique character plot in a track indicates the current position of an airplane, while the line plot in a track indicates the airplane trails. At iteration number ten, a collision will occur between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 when their original routes are applied in Fig. 1a. The collision is indicated by the zero distance between them (Fig. 2a). VAC Modelling Solution We run the VAC algorithm at each iteration in our flight simulation. The collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 in the initial flight route simulation (Fig. 1a) is avoided. The avoided collision is indicated by the non-zero distance (> 5 NM) along the (Fig. 1b). The new routes are obtained by changing the speed and or altitude for every airplane to meet the safety distance constraint (). This result proves that the VAC algorithm is effective to prevent the collision between Airplane 2 and 3. We then included a dynamic cloud in our simulation and run the VAC algorithm in our collision avoidance modelling. Here, we model the dynamic cloud as an aerial object with a large radius (e.g., 7.5 Nm), low  Yudhi Purwananto et al. / Journal of Computer Science 2021, 17 (1): 33.43 DOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2021.33.43  39 velocity and occupies several altitude layers. Note that the safety radius is the addition of the cloud radius and the pane safety radius and therefore 7.5+2.5 Nm = 10 Nm (Table 2). We run our simulation using the same six flights (Table 1) with the addition of cumulonimbus clouds (Table 2). With the default scenario, this experiment results in the collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 and also between Airplane 4 and the cloud (Fig. 1c). Then, we run our collision avoidance modelling using the same scenario. The VAC modelling provides route changes (altitude or speed) for every airplane to avoid collision between airplanes and the cloud (Fig. 1d). The collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 are avoided as well as the collision between Airplane 4 and the cloud (the red circle). Our experiment result indicates that collisions between airplanes and the clouds are avoided indicated by non-zero distances of every airplane to any other objects in the simulation (Fig. 2b).

Then, we compare the solutions produced by the VTAC modelling against the VAC modelling. The collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 is avoided by >6 NM (Fig. 3a). The distance produced by the VTAC modelling is longer than the VAC modelling (>5 NM). The longer distance is due to the VTAC modelling not only for providing solutions to change speed and altitude, but also the angle of the planes. The change of angle is indicated by the route of Airplane 2 that moves away from Airplane 3 by moving towards positive direction of the Y axis (Fig. 3a). This result proves that the VTAC modelling produces a safer solution than that of the VAC modelling. In fact, not only the collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 is avoided, but also the distance between Airplane 1 and Airplane 4 is extended.

The routes of the other airplanes are not changed because the distances between them are sufficiently far (Fig. 4a).  A dynamic cloud and six airplanes are run in our simulation with the same type and details as in the VAC scenario (Table 1 and 2). Here, the collision between Airplane 2 and Airplane 3 is avoided by >6 NM (Fig. 3b) by the change of speed (Airplane 3) and the change of angle (Airplane 2). Now, the presence of cloud that lies on altitude level 2, 3 and 4 is avoided by changing the angle of Airplane 4. The course of Airplane 4 is still in the safety zone despite the presence and the course of Airplane 1 (Fig. 4b). This solution is more practical compared to changing the altitude of Airplane 4 to level 1 as proposed by the VAC modelling (Fig. 1d). We extended our experiment by using 16 airplanes flying on altitude 1, 3 and 4. First, the simulation was run without the use of our VTAC algorithm resulting in minimum, maximum and average distances of 60, 1720.5 and 831.1 Nm respectively. There is no change of altitude levels among the airplanes. Then, we run the same simulation with the use of our VTAC algorithm. The experiment resulted in minimum, maximum and average distances of 141.4, 1720.5 and 830.4 Nm respectively. The minimum distances expanded as the results of the change of the altitude levels of some airplanes. This experiment strengthens our initial experimental result. Conclusion We developed an effective collision avoidance modelling that involves airplanes and a dynamic cloud that could be applicable in countries with cumulonimbus clouds, e.g., Indonesia. The VAC modelling was successfully experimented to avoid a collision by lowering the altitude and or change no cloud that lays on every altitude level. However, when such cloud exists, the technique might not work. This problem is solved in VTAC modelling that includes the change of flight angle. Thus, a collision with such cloud that lays on every altitude level can be avoided. The VTAC algorithm produced longer distance to avoid collision between airplanes by at least 1 Nautical Mile (NM) compared to the VAC algorithm. The addition of angle in the VTAC algorithm has improved the result significantly. Our collision avoidance method could be extended to multi clouds. We would like to use a real data from the Air Traffic Controller to examine the robustness of our method. The characteristics of large-scale real data with its various flight scenarios could possibly give a more deeper insight to the development of our method.
